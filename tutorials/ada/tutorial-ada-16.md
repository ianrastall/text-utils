# 16\. Embedded Systems Programming in Ada: Building Smart Devices for Everyday Life

> "Embedded systems programming isn't just for aerospace engineers—it's about controlling hardware in everyday devices like smart thermostats and wearable tech. Ada provides safe, reliable tools for this task without requiring specialized knowledge."

When you think of embedded systems, you might imagine complex aerospace control systems or medical devices. But embedded systems are actually everywhere in daily life—your smart thermostat, fitness tracker, coffee maker, and even your car's infotainment system all run on embedded software. These systems are specialized computers designed to control specific hardware functions, often with real-time constraints and limited resources. Unlike general-purpose computers that run complex applications, embedded systems focus on dedicated tasks with precise timing requirements.

Ada is uniquely suited for embedded programming because it provides strong type safety, direct hardware access, and built-in real-time support—all while maintaining reliability without requiring specialized safety-critical knowledge. This chapter explores how you can use Ada to build embedded systems for everyday applications, from home automation to IoT devices. You'll learn the fundamental concepts, practical techniques, and simple examples that let you control hardware directly while avoiding common pitfalls.

## Why Embedded Systems Matter for Everyday Applications

Embedded systems are the invisible brains behind countless devices we use every day. Consider these common examples:

- **Smart home devices**: Thermostats, lighting systems, and security cameras
- **Wearables**: Fitness trackers, smartwatches, and health monitors
- **Consumer electronics**: Coffee makers, washing machines, and smart TVs
- **Automotive systems**: Engine control units, infotainment systems, and sensors

These systems differ from general-purpose computers in key ways:
- They're designed for specific tasks rather than general computing
- They often have strict timing requirements (real-time constraints)
- They typically run on limited hardware resources (small memory, low-power processors)
- They interact directly with physical hardware (sensors, actuators, displays)

Ada excels in this environment because it provides:
- **Strong type safety**: Prevents accidental errors when working with hardware registers
- **Direct hardware access**: Safe memory-mapped I/O without unsafe pointer operations
- **Built-in real-time support**: Tasking and timing primitives without external libraries
- **No hidden memory management**: Predictable behavior without garbage collection pauses

Unlike C, which is commonly used for embedded systems but lacks built-in safety features, Ada provides compile-time checks that prevent common errors like buffer overflows, type mismatches, and uninitialized variables. This means your embedded code is more reliable from the start, without requiring specialized safety-critical knowledge.

## Basic Embedded Concepts

Before diving into code, let's understand the fundamental concepts of embedded systems programming.

### Memory-Mapped I/O

In embedded systems, hardware components like sensors, LEDs, and buttons are controlled through memory addresses. This is called **memory-mapped I/O**—the hardware registers appear as memory locations that your program can read and write.

For example, a simple LED might be controlled by writing to a specific memory address. When you write a 1 to that address, the LED turns on; writing 0 turns it off. This is how embedded systems interact with physical hardware.

### Bit Manipulation

Many hardware registers control multiple features through individual bits. For example, a single 8-bit register might control:
- Bit 0: LED on/off
- Bit 1: Button state
- Bit 2-7: Other sensor readings

To control individual bits without affecting others, you need **bit manipulation**—techniques for setting, clearing, and checking specific bits in a register.

### Interrupts

Interrupts are signals from hardware that pause the current program execution to handle urgent events. For example, when a button is pressed, the hardware generates an interrupt to notify the software. The software then handles the event before returning to normal operation.

### Real-Time Constraints

Embedded systems often have strict timing requirements. For example, a motor controller might need to update its output every 10 milliseconds to maintain smooth operation. Missing these deadlines can cause system failures.

## Ada Features for Embedded Development

Ada provides several features specifically designed for embedded programming, making it safer and more reliable than many alternatives.

### Volatile Variables

Hardware registers can change outside your program's control (for example, when a sensor updates). To prevent the compiler from optimizing away reads or writes, you must mark these variables as **volatile**.

```ada
with System;
with Interfaces;

package LED_Control is
   type LED_Register is record
      Control : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
      Data    : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
   end record
     with Volatile_Full_Access, Size => 16,
          Bit_Order => System.Low_Order_First,
          Address => 16#4000_0000#;

   LED_Register : LED_Register
     with Import, Address => 16#4000_0000#;
end LED_Control;
```

The `Volatile_Full_Access` aspect ensures the compiler doesn't optimize away reads or writes to the hardware register. Without this, the compiler might remove "unnecessary" operations, causing your hardware to behave incorrectly.

### Address Clauses

To map hardware registers to memory locations, you use **address clauses**. These tell the compiler exactly where in memory a variable should be placed.

```ada
LED_Register : LED_Register
  with Import, Address => 16#4000_0000#;
```

This places the `LED_Register` variable at memory address `0x4000_0000`. The exact address depends on your hardware—consult your microcontroller's datasheet for the correct addresses.

### Bit Manipulation Packages

Ada provides packages for bit manipulation, making it easy to work with individual bits in registers:

```ada
with Interfaces; use Interfaces;
with System.Storage_Elements; use System.Storage_Elements;

procedure Set_LED is
   LED_Register : Unsigned_8 := 0;
begin
   -- Set bit 0 (turn on LED)
   LED_Register := LED_Register or 2#0000_0001#;
   
   -- Clear bit 0 (turn off LED)
   LED_Register := LED_Register and not 2#0000_0001#;
   
   -- Check if bit 0 is set
   if (LED_Register and 2#0000_0001#) /= 0 then
      -- LED is on
   end if;
end Set_LED;
```

These bitwise operations let you control individual bits without affecting other bits in the register.

### Tasking for Concurrency

Embedded systems often need to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Ada's built-in tasking model makes this straightforward:

```ada
task type Sensor_Reader is
   entry Start;
end Sensor_Reader;

task body Sensor_Reader is
begin
   accept Start;
   loop
      Read_Sensor;
      delay 0.1; -- 100ms sampling interval
   end loop;
end Sensor_Reader;
```

This task reads a sensor every 100ms while the main program continues executing other tasks. No external libraries are needed—this is built into the language.

### No Hidden Memory Management

Unlike languages with garbage collection (like Java or Python), Ada gives you predictable memory behavior. You control exactly when memory is allocated and freed, avoiding unexpected pauses that could miss real-time deadlines.

## Practical Example: Blinking an LED with Ada

Let's create a simple embedded project that blinks an LED on a Raspberry Pi. This example demonstrates the core concepts we've covered: memory-mapped I/O, volatile variables, and timing control.

### Setting Up Your Environment

To run this example, you'll need:
- A Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
- GNAT for ARM (available from AdaCore)
- A breadboard and LED
- A 220Ω resistor

First, install GNAT for ARM:
```bash
# On Ubuntu
sudo apt install gnat-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

Create a project directory:
```bash
mkdir blink_led
cd blink_led
```

Create a project file `blink_led.gpr`:
```ada
project Blink_LED is
   for Source_Dirs use ("src");
   for Object_Dir use "obj";
   for Main use ("src/blink_led.adb");
   
   package Compiler is
      for Default_Switches ("Ada") use ("-g", "-O0", "-gnata");
   end Compiler;
end Blink_LED;
```

### Creating the Hardware Interface

Create a package to interface with the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins:

```ada
-- src/gpio.ads
with System;
with Interfaces;

package GPIO is
   type GPIO_Register is record
      Output_Enable : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
      Data_Set      : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
      Data_Clear    : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
      Data_Level    : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
   end record
     with Volatile_Full_Access, Size => 32,
          Bit_Order => System.Low_Order_First,
          Address => 16#2020_0000#;

   GPIO_Register : GPIO_Register
     with Import, Address => 16#2020_0000#;
   
   -- GPIO pin 18 (physical pin 12)
   LED_Pin : constant Natural := 18;
   
   procedure Turn_On_LED;
   procedure Turn_Off_LED;
   procedure Toggle_LED;
end GPIO;
```

```ada
-- src/gpio.adb
package body GPIO is
   procedure Turn_On_LED is
   begin
      -- Set bit 18 in Data_Set register
      GPIO_Register.Data_Set := 16#0004_0000#; -- 1 << 18
   end Turn_On_LED;
   
   procedure Turn_Off_LED is
   begin
      -- Set bit 18 in Data_Clear register
      GPIO_Register.Data_Clear := 16#0004_0000#; -- 1 << 18
   end Turn_Off_LED;
   
   procedure Toggle_LED is
   begin
      -- Read current state
      declare
         Current : Interfaces.Unsigned_8 := GPIO_Register.Data_Level;
      begin
         if (Current and 16#0004_0000#) /= 0 then
            Turn_Off_LED;
         else
            Turn_On_LED;
         end if;
      end;
   end Toggle_LED;
end GPIO;
```

### Creating the Blink Application

Now create the main program that blinks the LED:

```ada
-- src/blink_led.adb
with Ada.Real_Time; use Ada.Real_Time;
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
with GPIO;

procedure Blink_LED is
   One_Second : constant Time_Span := Seconds(1);
begin
   -- Configure GPIO pin 18 as output
   GPIO.GPIO_Register.Output_Enable := 16#0004_0000#; -- 1 << 18
   
   loop
      GPIO.Toggle_LED;
      delay until Clock + One_Second;
   end loop;
end Blink_LED;
```

### Building and Running the Code

Compile and transfer the code to your Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# On your development machine
gnatmake -P blink_led.gpr -cargs -mlittle-endian -march=armv6 -mtune=arm1176jzf-s
# Copy to Raspberry Pi
scp blink_led pi@raspberrypi.local:~/blink_led
```

On the Raspberry Pi, run the program:
```bash
sudo ./blink_led
```

The LED should blink once per second. Press Ctrl+C to stop the program.

### Understanding the Code

Let's break down what's happening:

1. **Memory-Mapped I/O**: The `GPIO_Register` is mapped to the physical memory address `0x2020_0000`, which is where the Raspberry Pi's GPIO registers are located.

2. **Volatile Variables**: The `Volatile_Full_Access` aspect ensures the compiler doesn't optimize away reads or writes to the hardware registers.

3. **Bit Manipulation**: To control individual pins, we use bitwise operations:
   - `16#0004_0000#` is `1 << 18` (bit 18 set)
   - Setting this in the Data_Set register turns on the LED
   - Setting this in the Data_Clear register turns off the LED

4. **Real-Time Timing**: The `Ada.Real_Time` package provides precise timing control with the `Clock` and `delay until` operations.

5. **No Hidden Memory Management**: The program uses static memory allocation, avoiding garbage collection pauses that could disrupt timing.

This example demonstrates how Ada provides safe, reliable hardware access without requiring specialized knowledge of low-level programming.

## Real-Time Aspects in Ada

Embedded systems often have strict timing requirements. Ada's built-in real-time features make it easy to meet these requirements.

### Simple Timing with Delays

For many embedded applications, simple timing with delays is sufficient:

```ada
procedure Blink_LED is
   One_Second : constant Time_Span := Seconds(1);
begin
   loop
      GPIO.Toggle_LED;
      delay until Clock + One_Second;
   end loop;
end Blink_LED;
```

The `delay until` operation ensures the LED toggles precisely every second, with no jitter or timing drift.

### Tasking for Concurrent Tasks

For more complex systems, Ada's tasking model lets you handle multiple tasks simultaneously:

```ada
task type Sensor_Reader is
   entry Start;
end Sensor_Reader;

task body Sensor_Reader is
begin
   accept Start;
   loop
      Read_Sensor;
      delay 0.1; -- 100ms sampling interval
   end loop;
end Sensor_Reader;

task type LED_Controller is
   entry Start;
end LED_Controller;

task body LED_Controller is
begin
   accept Start;
   loop
      Toggle_LED;
      delay 1.0; -- 1 second interval
   end loop;
end LED_Controller;

procedure Main is
begin
   Sensor_Reader.Start;
   LED_Controller.Start;
   
   loop
      -- Main program continues running
      delay 1.0;
   end loop;
end Main;
```

This example has two tasks:
- `Sensor_Reader` reads a sensor every 100ms
- `LED_Controller` toggles an LED every second

Both tasks run concurrently without interfering with each other.

### Real-Time Constraints

For applications with strict timing requirements, Ada provides precise control:

```ada
task type Control_Task is
   pragma Priority (System.Priority'Last - 10);
   pragma Deadline (Seconds => 0.01); -- 10ms deadline
end Control_Task;

task body Control_Task is
begin
   loop
      Process_Sensor_Data;
      delay until Clock + Milliseconds(10);
   end loop;
exception
   when Deadline_Error =>
      Handle_Missed_Deadline;
end Control_Task;
```

This task has:
- A priority of `System.Priority'Last - 10` (high priority)
- A deadline of 10ms for each iteration
- Automatic handling of missed deadlines

## Tools for Embedded Development with Ada

Several tools make embedded development with Ada easier and more efficient.

### GNAT for ARM

GNAT for ARM is the standard compiler for embedded Ada development. It supports:
- Cross-compilation for ARM processors
- Optimization for embedded targets
- Debugging support with GDB
- Integration with common embedded IDEs

To install GNAT for ARM:
```bash
# On Ubuntu
sudo apt install gnat-arm-linux-gnueabihf

# On macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install gnat-arm-linux-gnueabihf
```

### Simulators for Testing

Before deploying to hardware, you can test your code with simulators:

```bash
# Install QEMU for ARM simulation
sudo apt install qemu-system-arm

# Run Ada code in simulation
qemu-system-arm -M raspi2 -kernel blink_led
```

Simulators let you test your code without physical hardware, making development faster and safer.

### Hardware Abstraction Layers

For portability across different hardware platforms, use hardware abstraction layers (HALs):

```ada
package HAL is
   procedure Initialize;
   procedure Turn_On_LED;
   procedure Turn_Off_LED;
   procedure Toggle_LED;
   procedure Delay_Milliseconds (Ms : Natural);
end HAL;
```

```ada
package body HAL is
   -- Implementation specific to hardware
   procedure Initialize is
   begin
      -- Configure GPIO pins
   end Initialize;
   
   -- Other procedures...
end HAL;
```

This abstraction lets you write application code that works across different hardware platforms with minimal changes.

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

Even with Ada's safety features, embedded programming has pitfalls. Here's how to avoid them.

### Pitfall: Incorrect Memory Addresses

**Problem**: Using the wrong memory address for hardware registers.

**Solution**: Always consult your hardware's datasheet for correct addresses. Use constants for addresses:

```ada
-- Good practice
GPIO_Register_Address : constant System.Address := 16#2020_0000#;
GPIO_Register : GPIO_Register
  with Import, Address => GPIO_Register_Address;
```

### Pitfall: Forgetting Volatile

**Problem**: Not marking hardware registers as volatile, causing compiler optimizations to remove necessary operations.

**Solution**: Always use `Volatile_Full_Access` for hardware registers:

```ada
-- Correct
type GPIO_Register is record ... end record
  with Volatile_Full_Access, Address => ...;
```

### Pitfall: Unhandled Interrupts

**Problem**: Not properly handling interrupts, causing system instability.

**Solution**: Use Ada's interrupt handling features:

```ada
procedure Handle_Interrupt is
begin
   -- Handle interrupt
end Handle_Interrupt;

pragma Attach_Handler (Handle_Interrupt, Interrupt_Number => 18);
```

### Best Practice: Test on Hardware Early

**Problem**: Waiting too long to test on actual hardware.

**Solution**: Test on hardware as early as possible, even for simple functionality. Use a simple LED blink program as your first test.

### Best Practice: Use Static Memory Allocation

**Problem**: Using dynamic memory allocation, which can cause unpredictable behavior.

**Solution**: Prefer static memory allocation for embedded systems:

```ada
-- Good
Buffer : array (1..100) of Byte;

-- Avoid
Buffer : access Byte := new Byte;
```

### Best Practice: Document Hardware Dependencies

**Problem**: Not documenting which hardware features your code depends on.

**Solution**: Clearly document hardware dependencies in comments:

```ada
-- This code requires:
-- - Raspberry Pi 3 or later
-- - LED connected to GPIO pin 18
-- - 220Ω resistor in series with LED
```

## Practical Exercise: Temperature Monitoring System

Let's build a complete embedded project: a temperature monitoring system for a home automation application.

### Project Overview

This system will:
- Read temperature from a DS18B20 sensor
- Display the temperature on an LCD
- Log temperature readings to a file
- Send alerts if temperature exceeds safe limits

### Step 1: Hardware Setup

You'll need:
- Raspberry Pi
- DS18B20 temperature sensor
- 4.7kΩ resistor
- 16x2 LCD display
- Breadboard and jumper wires

Connect the hardware:
- DS18B20 data pin to GPIO 4
- LCD data pins to GPIO 17-22
- Power and ground connections

### Step 2: Create the Project Structure

```bash
mkdir temperature_monitor
cd temperature_monitor
mkdir src
```

Create `temperature_monitor.gpr`:
```ada
project Temperature_Monitor is
   for Source_Dirs use ("src");
   for Object_Dir use "obj";
   for Main use ("src/main.adb");
   
   package Compiler is
      for Default_Switches ("Ada") use ("-g", "-O0", "-gnata");
   end Compiler;
end Temperature_Monitor;
```

### Step 3: Implement the Hardware Interfaces

First, create the GPIO interface:

```ada
-- src/gpio.ads
with System;
with Interfaces;

package GPIO is
   type GPIO_Register is record
      Output_Enable : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
      Data_Set      : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
      Data_Clear    : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
      Data_Level    : Interfaces.Unsigned_8;
   end record
     with Volatile_Full_Access, Size => 32,
          Bit_Order => System.Low_Order_First,
          Address => 16#2020_0000#;

   GPIO_Register : GPIO_Register
     with Import, Address => 16#2020_0000#;
   
   -- GPIO pin definitions
   LED_Pin    : constant Natural := 18;
   Sensor_Pin : constant Natural := 4;
   LCD_RS     : constant Natural := 17;
   LCD_E      : constant Natural := 22;
   LCD_D4     : constant Natural := 23;
   LCD_D5     : constant Natural := 24;
   LCD_D6     : constant Natural := 25;
   LCD_D7     : constant Natural := 26;
   
   procedure Configure_Pin (Pin : Natural; Direction : Boolean);
   procedure Set_Pin (Pin : Natural; Value : Boolean);
   function Get_Pin (Pin : Natural) return Boolean;
end GPIO;
```

```ada
-- src/gpio.adb
package body GPIO is
   procedure Configure_Pin (Pin : Natural; Direction : Boolean) is
      -- Configure pin as input or output
   begin
      -- Implementation specific to hardware
      null;
   end Configure_Pin;
   
   procedure Set_Pin (Pin : Natural; Value : Boolean) is
      -- Set pin high or low
   begin
      -- Implementation specific to hardware
      null;
   end Set_Pin;
   
   function Get_Pin (Pin : Natural) return Boolean is
      -- Read pin state
   begin
      -- Implementation specific to hardware
      return False;
   end Get_Pin;
end GPIO;
```

Next, create the DS18B20 sensor interface:

```ada
-- src/ds18b20.ads
package DS18B20 is
   function Read_Temperature return Float;
end DS18B20;
```

```ada
-- src/ds18b20.adb
package body DS18B20 is
   function Read_Temperature return Float is
      -- Implementation of 1-Wire protocol
      -- Read temperature from sensor
   begin
      return 22.5; -- Simulated temperature
   end Read_Temperature;
end DS18b20;
```

Create the LCD interface:

```ada
-- src/lcd.ads
package LCD is
   procedure Initialize;
   procedure Write_String (Str : String);
   procedure Clear_Screen;
end LCD;
```

```ada
-- src/lcd.adb
package body LCD is
   procedure Initialize is
      -- Initialize LCD display
   begin
      -- Implementation specific to hardware
      null;
   end Initialize;
   
   procedure Write_String (Str : String) is
      -- Write string to LCD
   begin
      -- Implementation specific to hardware
      null;
   end Write_String;
   
   procedure Clear_Screen is
      -- Clear LCD screen
   begin
      -- Implementation specific to hardware
      null;
   end Clear_Screen;
end LCD;
```

### Step 4: Implement the Main Application

```ada
-- src/main.adb
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;
with Ada.Real_Time; use Ada.Real_Time;
with GPIO; use GPIO;
with DS18B20; use DS18B20;
with LCD; use LCD;

procedure Main is
   One_Second : constant Time_Span := Seconds(1);
   Temperature : Float;
begin
   -- Configure GPIO pins
   Configure_Pin (Sensor_Pin, False); -- Input
   Configure_Pin (LCD_RS, True);      -- Output
   Configure_Pin (LCD_E, True);       -- Output
   Configure_Pin (LCD_D4, True);      -- Output
   Configure_Pin (LCD_D5, True);      -- Output
   Configure_Pin (LCD_D6, True);      -- Output
   Configure_Pin (LCD_D7, True);      -- Output
   
   -- Initialize LCD
   Initialize;
   
   loop
      -- Read temperature
      Temperature := Read_Temperature;
      
      -- Display on LCD
      Clear_Screen;
      Write_String ("Temp: " & Temperature'Image & "C");
      
      -- Log to file
      declare
         File : File_Type;
      begin
         Open (File, Out_File, "temperature.log");
         Put_Line (File, Ada.Calendar.Clock'Image & " - " & Temperature'Image & "C");
         Close (File);
      end;
      
      -- Check for alerts
      if Temperature > 30.0 then
         Set_Pin (LED_Pin, True);
      else
         Set_Pin (LED_Pin, False);
      end if;
      
      -- Wait before next reading
      delay until Clock + One_Second;
   end loop;
end Main;
```

### Step 5: Build and Test

```bash
# On development machine
gnatmake -P temperature_monitor.gpr -cargs -mlittle-endian -march=armv6 -mtune=arm1176jzf-s

# Transfer to Raspberry Pi
scp temperature_monitor pi@raspberrypi.local:~/temperature_monitor

# On Raspberry Pi
cd temperature_monitor
sudo ./temperature_monitor
```

You should see the temperature displayed on the LCD, with alerts triggered when temperature exceeds 30°C.

Ada is uniquely suited for embedded systems programming because it provides strong type safety, direct hardware access, and built-in real-time support—all while maintaining reliability without requiring specialized safety-critical knowledge. Whether you're building a simple LED blinker or a complex home automation system, Ada gives you the tools to control hardware safely and reliably.

For beginners, Ada's features make embedded programming accessible without requiring deep knowledge of low-level programming. The strong type system prevents common errors, the direct hardware access is safe and predictable, and the built-in real-time support makes timing control straightforward.

As you continue your journey with Ada, remember that embedded systems programming is about controlling hardware to solve real-world problems. Whether you're building a smart home device, a wearable tech gadget, or a simple IoT sensor, Ada provides the tools to do it safely and reliably.

The key to success is starting small. Begin with simple projects like blinking an LED, then gradually add complexity as you gain confidence. Use the tools and resources available in the Ada community, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.

Embedded systems programming with Ada isn't just for safety-critical applications—it's for anyone who wants to build reliable, safe hardware control systems for everyday use. With Ada, you can turn your ideas into reality with confidence that your code will work as intended.
