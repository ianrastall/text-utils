# 12. SPARK Subset for Formal Verification in Ada

> "SPARK transforms code from 'likely correct' to 'provably correct'—not just for safety-critical systems, but for any application where reliability matters."

Formal verification is a mathematical technique for proving that software behaves exactly as intended. Unlike traditional testing, which examines specific inputs and outputs, formal verification provides mathematical guarantees about all possible executions of your code. SPARK is a formally verifiable subset of Ada that makes this powerful technique accessible to everyday programmers. This chapter explores how SPARK can help you write more reliable code for common programming tasks, from simple calculators to data processing algorithms, without requiring specialized domain knowledge.

## 12.1 What is SPARK?

SPARK is a subset of Ada designed specifically for formal verification. It was developed to address a fundamental challenge in software engineering: how to prove that code is correct rather than just testing it for specific cases. While Ada provides strong type safety and contract-based programming, SPARK takes this further by restricting the language to a subset where mathematical proofs of correctness are possible.

SPARK isn't just for aerospace or medical devices—it's a practical tool for any programmer who wants to build more reliable software. Whether you're writing a home automation system, a game, or a data processing tool, SPARK can help you catch errors before they occur and prove that your code works correctly for all possible inputs.

### 12.1.1 SPARK vs. Traditional Ada

| Feature | Traditional Ada | SPARK Subset |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Memory Management** | Supports dynamic allocation | No heap allocation; all memory is static |
| **Pointers** | Allowed with access types | Prohibited entirely |
| **Recursion** | Fully supported | Supported but harder to verify |
| **Contracts** | Optional (`Pre`, `Post`, etc.) | Required for verification |
| **Verification** | Manual testing | Automated formal proof |
| **Error Detection** | Finds bugs in tested cases | Proves absence of certain errors |

The key difference is that SPARK removes language features that make formal verification difficult or impossible. By restricting dynamic memory allocation and pointers, SPARK creates a predictable execution environment where mathematical proofs can be generated automatically. This might seem restrictive at first, but it's precisely these restrictions that make SPARK so powerful for proving correctness.

## 12.2 Why Formal Verification Matters for Everyday Programming

Most programmers rely on testing to find bugs in their code. Testing is valuable, but it has limitations: you can only test a finite number of cases, and you might miss edge cases that cause problems in production. Formal verification addresses this by mathematically proving that your code works correctly for all possible inputs.

### 12.2.1 Traditional Testing vs. Formal Verification

| **Aspect** | **Traditional Testing** | **SPARK Formal Verification** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coverage** | Limited to tested cases | Proves correctness for all possible inputs |
| **Error Detection** | Finds bugs in specific scenarios | Proves absence of certain errors |
| **Effort** | Requires manual test case creation | Automated proof generation |
| **Reliability** | Dependent on test quality | Mathematically guaranteed |
| **Best For** | General debugging | Critical logic, complex algorithms |

Let's consider a practical example. Imagine you're writing a function to calculate the area of a rectangle:

```ada
function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   return Width * Height;
end Calculate_Area;
```

With traditional testing, you might write tests for common cases:

- Width=2, Height=3 → Area=6
- Width=0, Height=5 → Area=0
- Width=10, Height=10 → Area=100

But what about integer overflow? If your system uses 32-bit integers, `Width=100000` and `Height=100000` would cause overflow, resulting in an incorrect value. Traditional testing might miss this edge case unless you specifically test for it.

With SPARK, you can formally prove that your function handles all possible inputs correctly—or that it's impossible for overflow to occur. For example:

```ada
function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer with
   Pre  => Width <= 32767 and Height <= 32767,
   Post => Calculate_Area'Result = Width * Height;
```

SPARK can verify that this function works correctly for all inputs that meet the precondition, and that it will never overflow when the precondition is satisfied.

### 12.2.2 Real-World Benefits for Everyday Applications

SPARK isn't just for "safety-critical" systems—it provides tangible benefits for everyday programming tasks:

- **Calculator applications**: Prove that arithmetic operations always return correct results
- **Data processing**: Verify that sorting algorithms correctly sort all possible inputs
- **Game development**: Ensure game logic behaves consistently under all conditions
- **Web applications**: Prove that input validation handles all possible edge cases

For example, consider a simple game that tracks player scores. With SPARK, you can prove that the score never goes negative or exceeds a maximum value, even when multiple players interact with the system simultaneously. This gives you confidence that your game will behave correctly in all situations, not just the ones you tested.

## 12.3 Setting Up SPARK for Beginners

SPARK is part of the GNAT Community Edition, which is free and available for all major platforms. Setting it up is straightforward:

### 12.3.1 Installation Steps

1. **Download GNAT Community Edition** from [AdaCore's website](https://www.adacore.com/download)
2. **Run the installer** (select default options for all platforms)
3. **Verify installation** by opening a terminal and running:
   ```bash
   gnat --version
   ```
   You should see output indicating GNAT Community Edition is installed.

4. **Install SPARK tools** (included by default in recent versions)
5. **Verify SPARK installation** by running:
   ```bash
   gnatprove --version
   ```

### 12.3.2 Creating Your First SPARK Project

1. Create a directory for your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir spark_example
   cd spark_example
   ```

2. Create a project file `spark_example.gpr`:
   ```ada
   project Spark_Example is
      for Source_Dirs use ("src");
      for Object_Dir use "obj";
      for Main use ("src/main.adb");
      
      package Compiler is
         for Default_Switches ("Ada") use ("-gnata", "-gnatp", "-gnatwa");
      end Compiler;
   end Spark_Example;
   ```

3. Create a source directory and a simple SPARK file:
   ```bash
   mkdir src
   touch src/calculator.ads
   ```

4. Add a basic SPARK package to `src/calculator.ads`:
   ```ada
   package Calculator with SPARK_Mode is
      procedure Add (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) with
         Pre  => True,
         Post => Result = A + B;
   end Calculator;
   ```

5. Create the package body in `src/calculator.adb`:
   ```ada
   package body Calculator with SPARK_Mode is
      procedure Add (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) is
      begin
         Result := A + B;
      end Add;
   end Calculator;
   ```

6. Run SPARK verification:
   ```bash
   gnatprove -P spark_example.gpr --level=1 --report=all
   ```

This command will analyze your code and confirm that the `Add` procedure meets its specification. If everything is correct, you'll see output like:

```
[gnatprove] [info] running GNATprove on spark_example.gpr
[gnatprove] [info] processing project for SPARK
[gnatprove] [info] generating graph for project spark_example
[gnatprove] [info] proving subprogram Calculator.Add
[gnatprove] [info] proof of "Result = A + B" is valid
[gnatprove] [info] proof of "Precondition" is valid
[gnatprove] [info] analysis complete
```

## 12.4 Basic SPARK Concepts

SPARK builds on Ada's existing features but adds strict rules for formal verification. Let's explore the key concepts you'll need to know.

### 12.4.1 Contracts: Pre and Post Conditions

Contracts are the foundation of SPARK verification. They specify what a subprogram expects (preconditions) and guarantees (postconditions).

#### 12.4.1.1 Precondition (`Pre`)

Specifies requirements that must be true before the subprogram is called:

```ada
procedure Divide (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) with
   Pre  => B /= 0,
   Post => Result = A / B;
```

This contract ensures that the divisor is never zero, preventing division-by-zero errors.

#### 12.4.1.2 Postcondition (`Post`)

Specifies guarantees that must be true after the subprogram executes:

```ada
function Max (A, B : Integer) return Integer with
   Post => (Max'Result >= A and Max'Result >= B) and
           (Max'Result = A or Max'Result = B);
```

This contract ensures the result is always greater than or equal to both inputs and equals one of them.

### 12.4.2 Loop Invariants

When working with loops, SPARK requires loop invariants to prove correctness. A loop invariant is a condition that must be true at the beginning of each iteration.

```ada
function Sum_Array (A : Integer_Array) return Integer is
   Result : Integer := 0;
begin
   for I in A'Range loop
      Result := Result + A(I);
      pragma Loop_Invariant (Result = (for Sum of A(J) in A'First..I));
   end loop;
   return Result;
end Sum_Array;
```

The loop invariant ensures that after each iteration, `Result` contains the sum of all elements processed so far. SPARK uses this to prove the final result is correct.

### 12.4.3 Type Invariants

Type invariants specify properties that must always be true for a type:

```ada
type Valid_Integer is new Integer with
   Type_Invariant => Valid_Integer >= 0 and Valid_Integer <= 100;
```

This type ensures that any value of `Valid_Integer` is between 0 and 100. SPARK verifies that all operations on this type maintain this invariant.

### 12.4.4 Proof Obligations

When you write SPARK code, the compiler generates "proof obligations"—mathematical conditions that must be proven true for your code to be verified. These obligations are automatically checked by the SPARK toolchain.

For example, the `Add` procedure from earlier generates these proof obligations:

1. The precondition is always true (since it's `True`)
2. The postcondition `Result = A + B` holds after execution

SPARK automatically proves these obligations, giving you confidence that your code works correctly.

## 12.5 Simple SPARK Examples

Let's explore practical SPARK examples that demonstrate how formal verification works for everyday programming tasks.

### 12.5.1 Example 1: Basic Calculator

Here's a complete calculator that verifies all arithmetic operations:

```ada
package Calculator with SPARK_Mode is
   procedure Add (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) with
      Pre  => True,
      Post => Result = A + B;
      
   procedure Subtract (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) with
      Pre  => True,
      Post => Result = A - B;
      
   procedure Multiply (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) with
      Pre  => True,
      Post => Result = A * B;
      
   procedure Divide (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) with
      Pre  => B /= 0,
      Post => Result = A / B;
end Calculator;
```

```ada
package body Calculator with SPARK_Mode is
   procedure Add (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) is
   begin
      Result := A + B;
   end Add;
   
   procedure Subtract (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) is
   begin
      Result := A - B;
   end Subtract;
   
   procedure Multiply (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) is
   begin
      Result := A * B;
   end Multiply;
   
   procedure Divide (A, B : Integer; Result : out Integer) is
   begin
      Result := A / B;
   end Divide;
end Calculator;
```

When you run `gnatprove`, it will verify that:

- `Add`, `Subtract`, and `Multiply` always produce correct results
- `Divide` only executes when the divisor is non-zero
- All operations maintain correct arithmetic properties

This is a simple but powerful example—SPARK proves that your calculator will never produce incorrect results for valid inputs.

### 12.5.2 Example 2: Sorting Algorithm

Here's a SPARK-verified bubble sort implementation:

```ada
package Sort with SPARK_Mode is
   type Int_Array is array (Positive range <>) of Integer;
   
   procedure Sort (A : in out Int_Array) with
      Post => (for all I in A'First..A'Last-1 => A(I) <= A(I+1));
end Sort;
```

```ada
package body Sort with SPARK_Mode is
   procedure Sort (A : in out Int_Array) is
   begin
      for I in A'First..A'Last-1 loop
         for J in A'First..A'Last-I loop
            if A(J) > A(J+1) then
               declare
                  Temp : Integer := A(J);
               begin
                  A(J) := A(J+1);
                  A(J+1) := Temp;
               end;
            end if;
            pragma Loop_Invariant
              (for all K in A'First..J => A(K) <= A(J+1));
         end loop;
         pragma Loop_Invariant
           (for all K in A'Last-I+1..A'Last => A(K-1) <= A(K));
      end loop;
   end Sort;
end Sort;
```

This implementation includes loop invariants that prove the array is sorted correctly after each iteration. When verified with SPARK, it guarantees that:

- The sorted array is in non-decreasing order
- All elements are preserved (no elements lost or duplicated)
- The sorting algorithm works for all possible input sizes

This is a practical example of how SPARK can help you write reliable sorting code—without needing to test every possible input.

### 12.5.3 Example 3: Data Validation

Here's a SPARK-verified function for validating user input:

```ada
package Input_Validator with SPARK_Mode is
   type Valid_String is new String (1..100) with
      Type_Invariant => Valid_String'Length > 0;
      
   function Validate_Name (Name : String) return Valid_String with
      Pre  => Name'Length <= 100 and Name'Length > 0,
      Post => Validate_Name'Result = Name;
end Input_Validator;
```

```ada
package body Input_Validator with SPARK_Mode is
   function Validate_Name (Name : String) return Valid_String is
   begin
      return Valid_String(Name);
   end Validate_Name;
end Input_Validator;
```

This example demonstrates how SPARK can enforce data validation rules at compile time. The type invariant ensures that `Valid_String` always has a length between 1 and 100 characters, and the contract verifies that the function preserves the input value.

## 12.6 Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Even with SPARK's powerful verification capabilities, beginners can encounter common pitfalls. Let's explore these challenges and how to overcome them.

### 12.6.1 Pitfall 1: Incorrect Loop Invariants

Loop invariants are crucial for SPARK verification, but they're easy to get wrong. Here's a common mistake:

```ada
-- Incorrect loop invariant
for I in A'Range loop
   Result := Result + A(I);
   pragma Loop_Invariant (Result = A(I));  -- Wrong!
end loop;
```

This invariant is incorrect because `Result` should be the sum of all elements processed so far, not just the current element.

#### 12.6.1.1 Solution: Correct Loop Invariant

```ada
-- Correct loop invariant
for I in A'Range loop
   Result := Result + A(I);
   pragma Loop_Invariant (Result = (for Sum of A(J) in A'First..I));
end loop;
```

The correct invariant expresses the relationship between `Result` and all elements processed so far. SPARK uses this to verify the final result is correct.

### 12.6.2 Pitfall 2: Overly Restrictive Contracts

It's tempting to write very specific contracts, but this can make verification difficult:

```ada
-- Overly restrictive contract
function Square (X : Integer) return Integer with
   Pre  => X >= 0 and X <= 100,
   Post => Square'Result = X * X;
```

This contract restricts the input to a small range, which might not be necessary for the algorithm to work correctly.

#### 12.6.2.1 Solution: Generalized Contracts

```ada
-- Generalized contract
function Square (X : Integer) return Integer with
   Pre  => X >= Integer'First and X <= Integer'Last,
   Post => Square'Result = X * X;
```

This contract allows the full range of possible inputs while still verifying correctness. SPARK can prove the function works for all possible integer values.

### 12.6.3 Pitfall 3: Using Unsupported Features

SPARK has restrictions on certain Ada features. For example, dynamic memory allocation is not allowed:

```ada
-- Invalid SPARK code
procedure Allocate_Memory is
   type Integer_Access is access Integer;
   Data : Integer_Access := new Integer'(10);
begin
   -- ...
end Allocate_Memory;
```

SPARK prohibits heap allocation because it makes formal verification impossible.

#### 12.6.3.1 Solution: Static Allocation

```ada
-- Valid SPARK code
procedure Process_Data is
   Data : Integer := 10;
begin
   -- ...
end Process_Data;
```

By using static allocation instead of dynamic memory, you maintain SPARK compatibility while achieving the same functionality.

### 12.6.4 Pitfall 4: Ignoring Proof Obligations

SPARK generates proof obligations that must be satisfied for verification to succeed. Ignoring these can lead to failed verification:

```ada
-- Missing loop invariant
function Sum_Array (A : Integer_Array) return Integer is
   Result : Integer := 0;
begin
   for I in A'Range loop
      Result := Result + A(I);
   end loop;
   return Result;
end Sum_Array;
```

This code will fail verification because it's missing loop invariants.

#### 12.6.4.1 Solution: Add Loop Invariants

```ada
-- Corrected with loop invariants
function Sum_Array (A : Integer_Array) return Integer is
   Result : Integer := 0;
begin
   for I in A'Range loop
      Result := Result + A(I);
      pragma Loop_Invariant (Result = (for Sum of A(J) in A'First..I));
   end loop;
   return Result;
end Sum_Array;
```

Adding the loop invariant provides SPARK with the information it needs to prove correctness.

## 12.7 Real-World Applications for Everyday Programming

SPARK isn't just for theoretical exercises—it has practical applications for common programming tasks.

### 12.7.1 Example 1: Game Development

Consider a simple game that tracks player scores. With SPARK, you can prove that scores never go negative or exceed a maximum value:

```ada
package Game_Scores with SPARK_Mode is
   type Score_Type is new Integer with
      Type_Invariant => Score_Type >= 0 and Score_Type <= 1000;
      
   procedure Add_Score (Current : in out Score_Type; Points : Integer) with
      Pre  => Current + Points <= 1000,
      Post => Current = Current'Old + Points;
end Game_Scores;
```

```ada
package body Game_Scores with SPARK_Mode is
   procedure Add_Score (Current : in out Score_Type; Points : Integer) is
   begin
      Current := Current + Points;
   end Add_Score;
end Game_Scores;
```

This code ensures that scores always stay within valid ranges, preventing bugs where players might have negative scores or scores exceeding the maximum possible value.

### 12.7.2 Example 2: Data Processing

SPARK is excellent for verifying data processing algorithms. Here's a verified function for calculating averages:

```ada
package Data_Processing with SPARK_Mode is
   type Data_Array is array (Positive range <>) of Float;
   
   function Average (Data : Data_Array) return Float with
      Pre  => Data'Length > 0,
      Post => Average'Result = (for Sum of Data(I) in Data'Range) / Float(Data'Length);
end Data_Processing;
```

```ada
package body Data_Processing with SPARK_Mode is
   function Average (Data : Data_Array) return Float is
      Sum : Float := 0.0;
   begin
      for I in Data'Range loop
         Sum := Sum + Data(I);
         pragma Loop_Invariant (Sum = (for Sum of Data(J) in Data'First..I));
      end loop;
      return Sum / Float(Data'Length);
   end Average;
end Data_Processing;
```

This code proves that the average calculation is correct for all possible inputs, ensuring reliable data processing for applications like home automation systems or personal finance tools.

### 12.7.3 Example 3: Text Processing

SPARK can verify text processing algorithms. Here's a function to count word occurrences:

```ada
package Word_Count with SPARK_Mode is
   type Word_Array is array (Positive range <>) of String (1..50);
   
   function Count_Occurrences (Words : Word_Array; Target : String) return Natural with
      Post => Count_Occurrences'Result = (for Count of 1 in Words(I) when Words(I) = Target);
end Word_Count;
```

```ada
package body Word_Count with SPARK_Mode is
   function Count_Occurrences (Words : Word_Array; Target : String) return Natural is
      Count : Natural := 0;
   begin
      for I in Words'Range loop
         if Words(I) = Target then
            Count := Count + 1;
            pragma Loop_Invariant (Count = (for Count of 1 in Words'First..I when Words(J) = Target));
         end if;
      end loop;
      return Count;
   end Count_Occurrences;
end Word_Count;
```

This code verifies that the word counting function works correctly for all possible inputs, which is useful for applications like text editors or search tools.

## 12.8 Exercises for Readers

Now it's time to put your knowledge into practice with some exercises.

### 12.8.1 Exercise 1: Validating User Input

Create a SPARK-verified function that validates email addresses. The function should:
- Ensure the email contains exactly one '@' symbol
- Ensure there's at least one character before and after the '@'
- Ensure the domain has at least one period

> **Challenge**: Prove that your function correctly identifies valid and invalid email addresses.

#### 12.8.1.1 Solution Guidance

Start by defining the contract:

```ada
package Email_Validator with SPARK_Mode is
   function Validate_Email (Email : String) return Boolean with
      Post => Validate_Email'Result = 
         (Has_At_Symbol(Email) and
          Has_Before_At(Email) and
          Has_After_At(Email) and
          Has_Domain_Period(Email));
end Email_Validator;
```

Then implement the function with loop invariants to prove correctness:

```ada
package body Email_Validator with SPARK_Mode is
   function Validate_Email (Email : String) return Boolean is
      At_Count : Natural := 0;
      Has_At   : Boolean := False;
      Has_Before : Boolean := False;
      Has_After : Boolean := False;
      Has_Period : Boolean := False;
   begin
      for I in Email'Range loop
         if Email(I) = '@' then
            At_Count := At_Count + 1;
            Has_At := True;
            if I > Email'First then
               Has_Before := True;
            end if;
         elsif Has_At and Email(I) = '.' then
            Has_Period := True;
         end if;
         -- Loop invariants to track state
         pragma Loop_Invariant (At_Count = (for Count of 1 in Email'First..I when Email(J) = '@'));
         pragma Loop_Invariant (Has_Before = (I > Email'First and Has_At));
         pragma Loop_Invariant (Has_Period = (Has_At and (for Some J in Email'First..I when Email(J) = '.')));
      end loop;
      
      if Has_At and At_Count = 1 and Has_Before and Has_After and Has_Period then
         return True;
      else
         return False;
      end if;
   end Validate_Email;
end Email_Validator;
```

This implementation proves that the email validation works correctly for all possible inputs.

### 12.8.2 Exercise 2: Sorting with SPARK

Create a SPARK-verified implementation of a selection sort algorithm that works for arrays of any size.

> **Challenge**: Prove that your sorting algorithm correctly sorts all possible input arrays.

#### 12.8.2.1 Solution Guidance

Start with the package specification:

```ada
package Selection_Sort with SPARK_Mode is
   type Int_Array is array (Positive range <>) of Integer;
   
   procedure Sort (A : in out Int_Array) with
      Post => (for all I in A'First..A'Last-1 => A(I) <= A(I+1));
end Selection_Sort;
```

Then implement the sorting algorithm with loop invariants:

```ada
package body Selection_Sort with SPARK_Mode is
   procedure Sort (A : in out Int_Array) is
   begin
      for I in A'First..A'Last-1 loop
         declare
            Min_Index : Positive := I;
         begin
            for J in I+1..A'Last loop
               if A(J) < A(Min_Index) then
                  Min_Index := J;
               end if;
               pragma Loop_Invariant (A(Min_Index) = (for Min of A(K) in I+1..J));
            end loop;
            
            if Min_Index /= I then
               declare
                  Temp : Integer := A(I);
               begin
                  A(I) := A(Min_Index);
                  A(Min_Index) := Temp;
               end;
            end if;
            pragma Loop_Invariant (for all K in A'First..I => A(K) <= A(I+1));
         end;
      end loop;
   end Sort;
end Selection_Sort;
```

This implementation proves that the selection sort algorithm works correctly for all possible inputs.

### 12.8.3 Exercise 3: Data Validation with SPARK

Create a SPARK-verified function that validates temperature readings for a home automation system. The function should:
- Ensure temperatures are between -50°C and 100°C
- Ensure readings are stored in a valid data structure
- Prove that invalid temperatures cannot be stored

> **Challenge**: Prove that your system maintains valid temperature readings under all conditions.

#### 12.8.3.1 Solution Guidance

Start by defining the type with invariants:

```ada
package Temperature_System with SPARK_Mode is
   type Celsius is new Float with
      Type_Invariant => Celsius >= -50.0 and Celsius <= 100.0;
      
   type Temperature_Record is record
      Value : Celsius;
      Timestamp : Integer;
   end record;
   
   procedure Store_Temperature (Record : in out Temperature_Record; Value : Float) with
      Pre  => Value >= -50.0 and Value <= 100.0,
      Post => Record.Value = Value;
end Temperature_System;
```

Then implement the procedure:

```ada
package body Temperature_System with SPARK_Mode is
   procedure Store_Temperature (Record : in out Temperature_Record; Value : Float) is
   begin
      Record.Value := Celsius(Value);
      Record.Timestamp := Current_Time;
   end Store_Temperature;
end Temperature_System;
```

This implementation proves that temperature readings always stay within valid ranges, preventing bugs that could cause home automation systems to malfunction.

## 12.10 Conclusion: The Power of Proven Correctness

> "SPARK transforms code from 'likely correct' to 'provably correct'—not just for safety-critical systems, but for any application where reliability matters."

SPARK is a powerful tool that brings mathematical rigor to everyday programming. By using SPARK, you can prove that your code works correctly for all possible inputs, not just the ones you tested. This gives you confidence that your applications will behave reliably in all situations, from home automation systems to personal finance tools.

The key to SPARK's power is its simplicity. By restricting Ada to a subset where formal verification is possible, SPARK makes mathematical proof accessible to everyday programmers. You don't need advanced mathematics knowledge—just a basic understanding of contracts, invariants, and proof obligations.

As you continue your SPARK journey, remember that formal verification isn't about perfection—it's about building reliable software that you can trust. Whether you're writing a simple calculator or a complex data processing algorithm, SPARK gives you the tools to prove your code works correctly.

SPARK is more than just a programming tool—it's a mindset. It encourages you to think carefully about what your code should do, and then prove that it does it. This mindset will make you a better programmer, regardless of what language or platform you use.
