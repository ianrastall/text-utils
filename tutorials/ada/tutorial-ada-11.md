# 11. Aspect Specifications and Pragmas in Ada

> **What Aspects and Pragmas Are**
> 
> "Aspects and pragmas are like special notes you write for the compiler - they don't change what your program does, but they tell the compiler how to handle your code better."

When you're learning to program, you might wonder: "How do I tell the compiler special things about my code?" Maybe you want to tell it to check certain conditions, optimize a function, or disable specific warnings. In Ada, you do this with **aspect specifications** and **pragmas**. These are special annotations that give the compiler additional information about your code without changing its logic.

For example, imagine you're writing a function to calculate the area of a rectangle:

```ada
function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   return Width * Height;
end Calculate_Area;
```

This works fine, but what if you want to make sure the width and height are positive? You could add a comment:

```ada
-- Width and Height must be positive
function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   return Width * Height;
end Calculate_Area;
```

But comments aren't checked by the compiler. With aspects, you can make the compiler actually enforce this:

```ada
function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer with
   Pre  => Width > 0 and Height > 0;
begin
   return Width * Height;
end Calculate_Area;
```

Now the compiler will check that `Width` and `Height` are positive before calling this function. If you try to call it with negative values, it will raise an error.

This is the power of aspects and pragmas - they let you tell the compiler exactly what you want it to do with your code, making your programs more reliable and efficient.

## 1.1 Understanding Aspect Specifications

Aspect specifications are a modern feature introduced in Ada 2012 that allow you to attach properties directly to declarations. They're more flexible and readable than older pragmas for many common tasks.

### 1.1.1 Basic Syntax of Aspect Specifications

Aspect specifications use the `with` keyword followed by the aspect name and value:

```ada
procedure My_Procedure with
   Aspect_Name => Value;
```

You can specify multiple aspects:

```ada
procedure My_Procedure with
   Aspect1 => Value1,
   Aspect2 => Value2;
```

For example, here's how to specify preconditions and postconditions for a function:

```ada
function Square (X : Integer) return Integer with
   Pre  => X >= 0,
   Post => Square'Result = X * X;
```

### 1.1.2 Where Aspects Can Be Used

Aspects can be used on many different kinds of declarations:

- **Subprograms** (functions, procedures)
- **Types** (records, arrays, etc.)
- **Packages**
- **Variables**
- **Constants**
- **Exceptions**

Let's look at examples of aspects on different entities.

### 1.1.3 Aspects on Subprograms

Subprograms are where aspects are most commonly used. Here's how to specify preconditions, postconditions, and other properties:

```ada
function Divide (A, B : Float) return Float with
   Pre  => B /= 0.0,
   Post => Divide'Result * B = A;

procedure Set_Temperature (Temp : Float) with
   Pre  => Temp >= -50.0 and Temp <= 50.0,
   Post => Current_Temperature = Temp;
```

These aspects tell the compiler to check that the input values meet certain conditions before the function is called, and that the output meets certain conditions after it returns.

### 1.1.4 Aspects on Types

You can use aspects to specify properties that must always be true for a type:

```ada
type Temperature is new Float with
   Type_Invariant => Temperature >= -50.0 and Temperature <= 50.0;

type Valid_String is new String (1..100) with
   Type_Invariant => Valid_String'Length > 0;
```

For records, you can specify invariants that apply to the entire record:

```ada
type Person is record
   Name  : String (1..50);
   Age   : Natural;
end record with
   Type_Invariant => Person.Age <= 120;
```

### 1.1.5 Aspects on Packages

You can specify aspects on packages too:

```ada
package Math_Utils with
   SPARK_Mode => On
is
   function Square (X : Float) return Float;
   function Cube (X : Float) return Float;
end Math_Utils;
```

This tells the compiler to use SPARK mode for this package, which enables formal verification.

## 1.2 Common Aspect Specifications

Ada has many built-in aspects that you can use to enhance your code. Let's look at the most common ones.

### 1.2.1 Pre and Post Conditions

Preconditions (`Pre`) and postconditions (`Post`) are used to specify what a subprogram expects and guarantees.

```ada
function Calculate_Discount (Price : Float; Is_Premium : Boolean) return Float with
   Pre  => Price > 0.0,
   Post => Calculate_Discount'Result <= Price;
```

This specifies that the price must be positive before calling the function, and the result must not exceed the original price.

### 1.2.2 Type Invariants

Type invariants specify properties that must always be true for a type:

```ada
type Bank_Account is record
   Balance : Float;
   Owner   : String (1..50);
end record with
   Type_Invariant => Bank_Account.Balance >= 0.0 and
                     Bank_Account.Owner'Length > 0;
```

This ensures that bank accounts always have non-negative balances and non-empty owner names.

### 1.2.3 SPARK Mode

SPARK mode enables formal verification for your code:

```ada
package Safety_Critical with
   SPARK_Mode => On
is
   procedure Process_Sensor (Value : Float) with
      Pre  => Value >= 0.0,
      Post => Process_Sensor'Result in 0.0..100.0;
end Safety_Critical;
```

This tells the compiler to check your code for correctness using formal methods.

### 1.2.4 Other Common Aspects

| **Aspect** | **Purpose** | **Example** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inline** | Suggests the compiler inline the subprogram | `procedure Add (A, B : Integer) with Inline;` |
| **Suppress** | Disables specific compiler checks | `pragma Suppress (Range_Check);` |
| **Convention** | Specifies calling convention for interfacing | `procedure C_Function with Convention => C;` |
| **Import** | Imports an external function | `procedure External_Function with Import, Convention => C;` |
| **Default_Initial_Condition** | Specifies initial state for objects | `type Counter with Default_Initial_Condition => 0;` |

## 1.3 Understanding Pragmas

Pragmas are compiler directives that have been part of Ada since the beginning. They're used for a wide variety of purposes, from optimizing code to controlling compiler behavior.

### 1.3.1 Basic Syntax of Pragmas

Pragmas use the `pragma` keyword followed by the pragma name and parameters:

```ada
pragma Pragma_Name (Parameter);
```

For example, to inline a function:

```ada
pragma Inline (Add);
```

You can also use pragmas with multiple parameters:

```ada
pragma Suppress (Range_Check, Divide_Check);
```

### 1.3.2 Where Pragmas Can Be Used

Pragmas can be used in various places in your code:

- At the beginning of a declaration
- Inside a package or subprogram body
- In a separate compilation unit

For example:

```ada
pragma Inline (Calculate_Area);

function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   return Width * Height;
end Calculate_Area;
```

### 1.3.3 Common Pragmas

Ada has many built-in pragmas. Let's look at the most common ones.

#### 1.3.3.1 Inline

Tells the compiler to replace a function call with the function's code directly:

```ada
pragma Inline (Calculate_Area);

function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   return Width * Height;
end Calculate_Area;
```

This can improve performance for small, frequently called functions.

#### 1.3.3.2 Suppress

Disables specific compiler checks to improve performance:

```ada
pragma Suppress (Range_Check);

function Safe_Get (A : Integer_Array; Index : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   return A(Index);
end Safe_Get;
```

This disables range checking for this function, but you should only do this when you're sure the index is always valid.

#### 1.3.3.3 Convention

Specifies the calling convention for interfacing with other languages:

```ada
pragma Convention (C, C_Function);

procedure C_Function (X : Integer) is
   external;
```

This tells the compiler to use the C calling convention for this function.

#### 1.3.3.4 Import

Imports an external function from another language:

```ada
pragma Import (C, External_Function);

procedure External_Function (X : Integer) is
   external;
```

This allows you to call C functions from your Ada code.

#### 1.3.3.5 Assert

Checks a condition at runtime:

```ada
procedure Process (X : Integer) is
begin
   pragma Assert (X > 0);
   -- Process X
end Process;
```

This checks that `X` is positive at runtime and raises an error if not.

### 1.3.4 Pragmas vs. Aspects

| **Feature** | **Aspects** | **Pragmas** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Introduction** | Ada 2012 | Ada 83 and earlier |
| **Syntax** | `with Aspect => Value` | `pragma Pragma_Name (Parameters)` |
| **Readability** | More readable, integrated with declarations | Less readable, separate from declarations |
| **Use Cases** | Specifications, contracts, type properties | Compiler directives, optimization, interfacing |
| **Flexibility** | More flexible for specifications | More flexible for compiler control |

As a general rule:
- Use **aspects** for specifications (preconditions, postconditions, type invariants)
- Use **pragmas** for compiler directives (inlining, suppressing checks, interfacing)

## 1.4 Practical Examples: Aspects and Pragmas in Everyday Programming

Let's look at some practical examples of how aspects and pragmas can improve your everyday programming.

### 1.4.1 Example 1: File Handling with Aspect Specifications

Imagine you're writing a program that reads data from a file. You can use aspects to specify what the file must contain:

```ada
procedure Read_File (Filename : String; Data : out String) with
   Pre  => Ada.Text_IO.Exists (Filename),
   Post => Data'Length > 0;

procedure Read_File (Filename : String; Data : out String) is
   File : Ada.Text_IO.File_Type;
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Open (File, Ada.Text_IO.In_File, Filename);
   Ada.Text_IO.Get_Line (File, Data);
   Ada.Text_IO.Close (File);
end Read_File;
```

This ensures that the file exists before reading and that data is actually read.

### 1.4.2 Example 2: Optimizing a Small Function with Pragmas

For small, frequently called functions, you can use pragmas to improve performance:

```ada
pragma Inline (Calculate_Area);

function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   return Width * Height;
end Calculate_Area;
```

This tells the compiler to replace calls to `Calculate_Area` with the actual code, eliminating the function call overhead.

### 1.4.3 Example 3: Type Safety with Type Invariants

You can use type invariants to ensure your data structures always stay valid:

```ada
type Bank_Account is record
   Balance : Float;
   Owner   : String (1..50);
end record with
   Type_Invariant => Bank_Account.Balance >= 0.0 and
                     Bank_Account.Owner'Length > 0;
```

Now, any time you create or modify a `Bank_Account`, Ada will check that the balance is non-negative and the owner name is not empty.

### 1.4.4 Example 4: Interfacing with C Libraries

When working with C libraries, you can use pragmas to properly interface with them:

```ada
pragma Import (C, C_Sqrt);

function C_Sqrt (X : Float) return Float;
```

This tells the compiler that `C_Sqrt` is implemented in C and should be called using the C calling convention.

## 1.5 Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

Even with aspects and pragmas, beginners can make mistakes. Let's look at common pitfalls and how to avoid them.

### 1.5.1 Pitfall 1: Using Pragmas for Specifications

Many beginners try to use pragmas for things that should be aspects. For example:

```ada
-- Bad practice: Using pragma for preconditions
pragma Pre (Width > 0 and Height > 0);
function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   return Width * Height;
end Calculate_Area;
```

This is incorrect because `Pre` is an aspect, not a pragma. The correct way is:

```ada
function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer with
   Pre  => Width > 0 and Height > 0;
begin
   return Width * Height;
end Calculate_Area;
```

### 1.5.2 Pitfall 2: Suppressing Checks Without Understanding

It's tempting to suppress checks to improve performance, but this can lead to subtle bugs:

```ada
-- Bad practice: Suppressing all checks without understanding
pragma Suppress (All_Checks);

function Safe_Get (A : Integer_Array; Index : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   return A(Index);
end Safe_Get;
```

This disables all runtime checks, including range checks and divide-by-zero checks. A better approach is to only suppress the specific checks you need:

```ada
-- Better practice: Suppress only necessary checks
pragma Suppress (Range_Check);

function Safe_Get (A : Integer_Array; Index : Integer) return Integer is
begin
   -- Ensure index is valid through other means
   return A(Index);
end Safe_Get;
```

### 1.5.3 Pitfall 3: Using Aspects on the Wrong Entity

Aspects must be used on the correct entity. For example:

```ada
-- Bad practice: Using Type_Invariant on a variable
type Integer_Array is array (Integer range <>) of Integer;
Data : Integer_Array with Type_Invariant => Data'Length > 0;
```

This is incorrect because `Type_Invariant` applies to types, not variables. The correct way is:

```ada
type Safe_Integer_Array is array (Integer range <>) of Integer with
   Type_Invariant => Safe_Integer_Array'Length > 0;

Data : Safe_Integer_Array;
```

### 1.5.4 Pitfall 4: Misunderstanding When Aspects Are Checked

Not all aspects are checked at runtime by default. For example:

```ada
function Divide (A, B : Float) return Float with
   Pre  => B /= 0.0;
begin
   return A / B;
end Divide;
```

This `Pre` aspect will only be checked if you compile with `-gnata` (or similar) compiler flag. Without it, the precondition is ignored.

### 1.5.5 Pitfall 5: Using Pragmas for Things That Should Be Aspects

Many pragmas have aspect equivalents that are more readable:

```ada
-- Bad practice: Using pragma for inlining
pragma Inline (Calculate_Area);

-- Better practice: Using aspect for inlining
function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer with
   Inline;
```

The aspect syntax is more readable and integrates better with the declaration.

## 1.6 Best Practices for Using Aspects and Pragmas

To get the most out of aspects and pragmas, follow these best practices:

### 1.6.1 \. Use Aspects for Specifications

For preconditions, postconditions, type invariants, and other specifications, use aspects rather than pragmas:

```ada
-- Good practice: Using aspects for specifications
function Square (X : Integer) return Integer with
   Pre  => X >= 0,
   Post => Square'Result = X * X;
```

### 1.6.2 \. Use Pragmas for Compiler Directives

For compiler-specific directives like inlining, suppressing checks, or interfacing, use pragmas:

```ada
-- Good practice: Using pragmas for compiler directives
pragma Inline (Calculate_Area);
pragma Suppress (Range_Check);
```

### 1.6.3 \. Be Specific with Suppression

When suppressing checks, be specific about which checks you're suppressing:

```ada
-- Good practice: Being specific with suppression
pragma Suppress (Range_Check);
pragma Suppress (Divide_Check);
```

Rather than suppressing all checks:

```ada
-- Bad practice: Suppressing all checks
pragma Suppress (All_Checks);
```

### 1.6.4 \. Document Your Aspects and Pragmas

Add comments to explain why you're using a particular aspect or pragma:

```ada
-- Using aspect for preconditions to ensure valid input
function Calculate_Area (Width, Height : Integer) return Integer with
   Pre  => Width > 0 and Height > 0;

-- Using pragma for inlining because this function is called frequently
pragma Inline (Calculate_Area);
```

### 1.6.5 \. Test Your Code with Aspects Enabled

When using aspects like preconditions, make sure to test with compiler flags that enable aspect checking:

```bash
gnatmake -gnata your_program.adb
```

This ensures that your aspects are actually checked during testing.

## 1.7 Practical Exercise: Building a Safe Temperature Controller

Let's put what we've learned into practice with a complete example of a temperature controller that uses aspects and pragmas.

### 1.7.1 Step 1: Define the Temperature Type with Type Invariant

First, we'll define a temperature type that ensures values are within a reasonable range:

```ada
type Celsius is new Float with
   Type_Invariant => Celsius >= -50.0 and Celsius <= 100.0;
```

This ensures that any temperature value is between -50°C and 100°C.

### 1.7.2 Step 2: Create a Safe Temperature Setting Function

Next, we'll create a function to set the temperature with preconditions:

```ada
procedure Set_Temperature (Temp : Celsius) with
   Pre  => Temp >= -50.0 and Temp <= 100.0,
   Post => Current_Temperature = Temp;
```

### 1.7.3 Step 3: Add a Function to Calculate Heat Output

Now, let's create a function to calculate heat output with aspects:

```ada
function Calculate_Heat_Output (Temp : Celsius) return Float with
   Pre  => Temp >= -50.0 and Temp <= 100.0,
   Post => Calculate_Heat_Output'Result >= 0.0;
```

### 1.7.4 Step 4: Optimize a Small Function with Pragmas

For small, frequently called functions, we can use pragmas for optimization:

```ada
pragma Inline (Calculate_Heat_Output);

function Calculate_Heat_Output (Temp : Celsius) return Float is
begin
   return (Temp + 50.0) * 0.5; -- Simple calculation
end Calculate_Heat_Output;
```

### 1.7.5 Step 5: Create a Complete Temperature Controller

Let's put it all together in a complete temperature controller:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

package Temperature_Controller is

   type Celsius is new Float with
      Type_Invariant => Celsius >= -50.0 and Celsius <= 100.0;

   procedure Set_Temperature (Temp : Celsius) with
      Pre  => Temp >= -50.0 and Temp <= 100.0,
      Post => Current_Temperature = Temp;

   function Get_Temperature return Celsius;

   function Calculate_Heat_Output (Temp : Celsius) return Float with
      Pre  => Temp >= -50.0 and Temp <= 100.0,
      Post => Calculate_Heat_Output'Result >= 0.0;

private
   Current_Temperature : Celsius := 22.0;

end Temperature_Controller;
```

```ada
package body Temperature_Controller is

   pragma Inline (Calculate_Heat_Output);

   function Calculate_Heat_Output (Temp : Celsius) return Float is
   begin
      return (Temp + 50.0) * 0.5;
   end Calculate_Heat_Output;

   procedure Set_Temperature (Temp : Celsius) is
   begin
      Current_Temperature := Temp;
   end Set_Temperature;

   function Get_Temperature return Celsius is
   begin
      return Current_Temperature;
   end Get_Temperature;

end Temperature_Controller;
```

### 1.7.6 Step 6: Test the Temperature Controller

Now let's test our temperature controller:

```ada
with Temperature_Controller; use Temperature_Controller;
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Test_Temperature is
   Temp : Celsius;
begin
   Set_Temperature(25.0);
   Temp := Get_Temperature;
   Put_Line ("Current temperature: " & Temp'Image);
   
   Put_Line ("Heat output: " & Calculate_Heat_Output(Temp)'Image);
   
   -- This would fail at runtime with -gnata:
   -- Set_Temperature(-60.0);
end Test_Temperature;
```

When compiled with `-gnata`, the program will check that temperatures stay within the valid range. If you try to set a temperature outside the range, it will raise an error.

## 1.8 Aspects and Pragmas in Real-World Applications

Let's look at how aspects and pragmas are used in real-world applications.

### 1.8.1 Example 1: Web Server with Aspect Specifications

A web server might use aspects to ensure proper handling of requests:

```ada
procedure Process_Request (Request : String; Response : out String) with
   Pre  => Request'Length <= MAX_REQUEST_SIZE,
   Post => Response'Length > 0;
```

This ensures that requests aren't too large and that responses are always generated.

### 1.8.2 Example 2: Data Processing with Type Invariants

A data processing application might use type invariants to ensure data consistency:

```ada
type Valid_Data is record
   Value : Float;
   Quality : Natural;
end record with
   Type_Invariant => Valid_Data.Value >= 0.0 and
                     Valid_Data.Quality <= 100;
```

This ensures that data values are non-negative and quality scores are between 0 and 100.

### 1.8.3 Example 3: Performance Optimization with Pragmas

For performance-critical code, pragmas can make a big difference:

```ada
pragma Inline (Calculate_Distance);

function Calculate_Distance (X1, Y1, X2, Y2 : Float) return Float is
begin
   return sqrt((X2 - X1)**2 + (Y2 - Y1)**2);
end Calculate_Distance;
```

This tells the compiler to inline the distance calculation, eliminating function call overhead.

## 1.9 Next Steps: Taking Your Skills Further

Now that you've learned about aspects and pragmas, here are some next steps to continue your Ada journey:

### 1.9.1 \. Explore Advanced Aspects

Ada has many more aspects you can explore:
- `SPARK_Mode` for formal verification
- `Default_Initial_Condition` for type initialization
- `Nonblocking` for tasking
- `Atomic` for concurrent programming

### 1.9.2 \. Learn About Compiler Flags

Learn how to use compiler flags to enable different levels of aspect checking:
- `-gnata` enables contract checking
- `-gnatp` enables all checks
- `-gnatwa` enables all warnings

### 1.9.3 \. Try Formal Verification

With SPARK, you can use aspects to formally verify your code:
```ada
package Safety_Critical with
   SPARK_Mode => On
is
   procedure Process_Sensor (Value : Float) with
      Pre  => Value >= 0.0,
      Post => Process_Sensor'Result in 0.0..100.0;
end Safety_Critical;
```

### 1.9.4 \. Build Larger Projects

Apply what you've learned to build larger projects:
- A home automation system with temperature control
- A simple game with performance-critical code
- A data processing application with strict data validation

Aspects and pragmas might seem like small features, but they're incredibly powerful. They let you tell the compiler exactly what you want it to do with your code, making your programs more reliable and efficient.

For beginners, aspects and pragmas might seem like advanced topics, but they're actually quite simple to use. By using aspects for specifications and pragmas for compiler directives, you can write code that's more reliable and easier to maintain.

As you continue your Ada journey, remember that aspects and pragmas are just tools to help you build better programs. Use them wisely, and you'll find that your code becomes more reliable, more efficient, and easier to understand.

## 1.10 Exercises: Putting Your Knowledge to Work

Now it's time to practice what you've learned with some exercises.

### 1.10.1 Exercise 1: Safe File Handling

Create a file handling package that uses aspects to ensure proper file operations.

> **Challenge**: Make sure files are properly closed even when exceptions occur.

#### 1.10.1.1 Solution Guidance

Start by defining a controlled type for file handling:

```ada
with Ada.Finalization;

package File_Handler is

   type File_Handle is new Ada.Finalization.Controlled with record
      File : Ada.Text_IO.File_Type;
   end record;

   procedure Initialize (Object : in out File_Handle);
   procedure Finalize (Object : in out File_Handle);

   procedure Open (Object : in out File_Handle; Name : String; Mode : Ada.Text_IO.File_Mode);
   procedure Read_Line (Object : in out File_Handle; Line : out String; Last : out Natural);

private
   procedure Initialize (Object : in out File_Handle);
   procedure Finalize (Object : in out File_Handle);
end File_Handler;
```

Then add aspects to the procedures:

```ada
procedure Open (Object : in out File_Handle; Name : String; Mode : Ada.Text_IO.File_Mode) with
   Pre  => not Ada.Text_IO.Is_Open (Object.File);
```

This ensures the file isn't already open before opening it again.

### 1.10.2 Exercise 2: Performance Optimization

Create a package with a small function that calculates the area of a circle, and optimize it with pragmas.

> **Challenge**: Make sure the function is inlined for performance.

#### 1.10.2.1 Solution Guidance

First, define the function:

```ada
package Circle_Calculations is

   function Calculate_Area (Radius : Float) return Float;

end Circle_Calculations;
```

Then implement it with an inline pragma:

```ada
package body Circle_Calculations is

   pragma Inline (Calculate_Area);

   function Calculate_Area (Radius : Float) return Float is
   begin
      return 3.14159 * Radius * Radius;
   end Calculate_Area;

end Circle_Calculations;
```

This tells the compiler to replace calls to `Calculate_Area` with the actual code, eliminating function call overhead.

### 1.10.3 Exercise 3: Data Validation with Type Invariants

Create a package for handling temperature data with type invariants.

> **Challenge**: Ensure all temperature values stay within valid ranges.

#### 1.10.3.1 Solution Guidance

Define a temperature type with a type invariant:

```ada
package Temperature_Data is

   type Celsius is new Float with
      Type_Invariant => Celsius >= -50.0 and Celsius <= 100.0;

   procedure Set_Temperature (Temp : Celsius) with
      Post => Current_Temperature = Temp;

   function Get_Temperature return Celsius;

private
   Current_Temperature : Celsius := 22.0;

end Temperature_Data;
```

Implement the package body:

```ada
package body Temperature_Data is

   procedure Set_Temperature (Temp : Celsius) is
   begin
      Current_Temperature := Temp;
   end Set_Temperature;

   function Get_Temperature return Celsius is
   begin
      return Current_Temperature;
   end Get_Temperature;

end Temperature_Data;
```

This ensures that any temperature value is between -50°C and 100°C, and that the current temperature is always set correctly.

## 1.11 Conclusion: The Power of Compiler Directives
