        <h2>Introduction: The Critical Nature of Multi-Core in Safety-Critical Systems</h2>
        <div class="section-block">
            <p>As safety-critical systems grow increasingly complex—from modern avionics with integrated modular architectures to medical devices with advanced imaging capabilities—the demand for computational power has driven adoption of multi-core processors. However, traditional multi-core approaches, designed for commercial throughput rather than safety certification, introduce interference channels that can compromise otherwise robust safety mechanisms. This tutorial explores how Ada provides a formal framework for building safety-critical multi-core systems that maintain predictable behavior, verifiable properties, and certification readiness while leveraging parallel hardware capabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Ada Philosophy:</strong> Parallelism should be <em>explicit, verifiable, and predictable</em>, not an afterthought. The language must provide mechanisms for multi-core programming that preserve high-integrity guarantees without sacrificing the determinism required for safety certification.</p>
            <p>Unlike general-purpose parallel programming frameworks that prioritize flexibility over determinism, Ada's Ravenscar and Jorvik profiles are specifically designed to address the unique challenges of safety-critical multi-core architectures. They provide language-level constructs that enable formal verification of parallel properties, predictable task scheduling, and integration with safety certification frameworks like DO-178C and IEC 62304. This tutorial examines how to leverage these features to build multi-core systems that maintain safety properties across processor boundaries while generating the necessary evidence for certification—addressing the critical interference channels that make multi-core certification challenging.</p>

            <h3>Case Study: Multi-Core Avionics Certification Failure</h3>
            <div class="note-box">
                <p>A major avionics manufacturer encountered certification difficulties when attempting to qualify a new flight control computer using a multi-core processor. The system met all functional requirements but failed to demonstrate acceptable timing behavior during certification testing. The root cause was traced to cache-related interference between safety-critical and non-critical tasks sharing the same processor core. The commercial RTOS used provided no mechanisms to analyze or control this interference, making it impossible to prove worst-case execution time (WCET).</p>
                <p><strong>Ada Perspective:</strong> Ada's Ravenscar profile, combined with partitioning strategies and interference channel analysis, would have provided the necessary control over task placement and resource sharing. The language-level integration of parallelism would have enabled proper verification of timing properties and interference channels during development rather than in certification review.</p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Ada's Multi-Core Philosophy:</strong> Parallel programming must be <em>predictable, verifiable, and type-safe</em> while maintaining the determinism required for safety certification. Ada achieves this through language-level support for controlled parallelism that preserves strong typing, enables formal verification of timing properties, and integrates with safety certification frameworks—without requiring developers to abandon abstraction or safety.</p>
