## 3.1 The "Hello, World!" Program

### 3.1.1 Program Structure: procedure, begin, end

Ada's program structure reflects its design philosophy of clarity and safety.
Let's examine the classic "Hello, World!" program in detail:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Hello is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Hello, World!");
end Hello;
```

This simple program demonstrates Ada's distinctive structural elements:

- **`with Ada.Text_IO;`**  
  The `with` clause declares a dependency on the `Ada.Text_IO` package. Unlike
  C/C++'s `#include` which copies header contents, `with` simply references
  the package interface, ensuring compile-time verification of the dependency.
  This is part of Ada's "safety first" philosophy—dependencies are checked at
  compilation, not at runtime.

- **`procedure Hello is`**  
  Every Ada program must have a top-level procedure as its entry point. The
  `procedure` keyword indicates this is an executable unit that performs
  actions but doesn't return a value. The name `Hello` follows PascalCase
  naming conventions (capitalizing the first letter of each word). The `is`
  keyword marks the beginning of the program's declarations section.

- **`begin...end Hello;`**  
  This is Ada's most distinctive structural feature. The `begin` keyword
  explicitly marks the start of executable code, and `end Hello;` precisely
  terminates the procedure. This explicit scope termination eliminates the
  "dangling else" problem common in C-style languages where missing braces can
  cause ambiguous code structure. For example:

  ```ada
  if Temperature > 100 then
     Alert_System.Activate;
     Log_Message("Overheat detected!");
  end if;  -- Clear end marker for the if statement
  ```

  Even with inconsistent indentation, the structure remains unambiguous. This
  design choice was intentional—Ada was created for systems with 20+ year
  lifespans where code must be readable decades later.

- **`Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Hello, World!");`**  
  The fully qualified call to `Put_Line` demonstrates Ada's namespace
  protection. Unlike languages that allow implicit imports of entire
  namespaces, Ada requires explicit qualification unless `use` clauses are
  applied. This prevents naming collisions—critical in large projects where
  multiple libraries might define similar functions.

Ada's structure is intentionally verbose to prioritize readability over
brevity. As one NASA engineer noted: "Code is read 10 times more often than it
is written. Ada ensures every reader understands the intent."

#### 3.1.1.1 Why Ada Requires Explicit Procedure Declarations

Unlike C or C++ where `main()` is a special function with implicit semantics,
Ada requires all programs to be declared as procedures with explicit syntax.
This design choice serves several critical purposes:

1. **Clarity of Intent**: Every program must be explicitly declared as a
   procedure, making it immediately clear that this is an executable unit. In
   C, `main()` is a special case that requires memorization of its special
   status.

2. **Consistency with Other Units**: All Ada units (procedures, functions,
   packages) follow the same declaration pattern, creating a uniform
   programming model. This consistency reduces cognitive load when navigating
   codebases.

3. **Explicit Scope Termination**: The `begin...end` structure creates clear
   boundaries for the executable code. In C, the `main()` function uses curly
   braces which can be easily mismatched or omitted, leading to subtle bugs.

4. **Safety Through Structure**: Ada's explicit structure prevents accidental
   execution of code outside of proper scopes. In C, global code outside
   functions is possible, which can lead to unexpected initialization order
   issues.

#### 3.1.1.2 The Evolution of Program Structure in Ada

Ada's program structure has remained remarkably consistent across versions,
demonstrating the stability of its design philosophy. Here's how it compares
to other languages:

| Language | Program Structure                                | Key Differences from Ada                                                               |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| C        | `int main() { ... }`                             | Implicit main function; curly braces for scope; no explicit termination markers        |
| C++      | `int main() { ... }`                             | Same as C; allows global code outside functions                                        |
| Java     | `public static void main(String[] args) { ... }` | Requires class declaration; static method; verbose parameter syntax                    |
| Python   | `print("Hello, World!")`                         | No explicit structure; global code allowed; no compilation step                        |
| Rust     | `fn main() { ... }`                              | Explicit function declaration; curly braces for scope; no explicit termination markers |

Ada's structure stands out for its explicitness. While other languages
prioritize brevity, Ada prioritizes clarity and safety. This is particularly
important in safety-critical systems where code must remain understandable for
decades.

#### 3.1.1.3 Real-World Example: Aeronautics Industry

Consider the Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight control system, which contains over
2 million lines of Ada code. Engineers report that new team members become
productive within days—not weeks—because the code is self-documenting. As one
lead developer stated: "In Ada, the code is the documentation. You don't need
to guess what a function does—you read its contract and scope."

The explicit structure of Ada programs means that even after 20 years, a
developer can understand the program flow without needing to consult
documentation or ask colleagues. This is critical for systems with 30+ year
lifecycles where original developers may no longer be available.

#### 3.1.1.4 The Importance of Explicit Scope Termination

Ada's requirement for explicit scope termination (`end if;`, `end loop;`,
`end procedure;`) eliminates an entire category of bugs that plague other
languages. Consider this C code:

```toml
if (temperature > 100)
    if (pressure > 50)
        alert_system_activate();
    else
        log_message("Pressure too high");
```

In this code, the `else` clause belongs to the inner `if` statement, not the
outer one. This is a common mistake that can lead to subtle bugs. In Ada, this
ambiguity is impossible:

```ada
if Temperature > 100 then
   if Pressure > 50 then
      Alert_System.Activate;
   else
      Log_Message("Pressure too high");
   end if;
end if;
```

The explicit `end if;` markers make the structure unambiguous. This is
particularly important in safety-critical systems where subtle logic errors
can have catastrophic consequences.

#### 3.1.1.5 Historical Context: The DoD's Decision for Explicit Syntax

Ada's structured syntax stems from the U.S. Department of Defense mandate to
standardize critical software in the late 1970s. Section 3.5.6 dives into the
full DoD narrative, but the key takeaway here is that the HOLWG chartered Ada
to make control flow unambiguous decades after delivery—a goal achieved with
explicit `begin`/`end` markers and named terminators.

### 3.1.2 Standard Libraries: with and use Clauses

In Ada, standard libraries are accessed through `with` and `use` clauses, but
they serve fundamentally different purposes:

#### 3.1.2.1 ✅ `with`: Declaring Dependencies

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;  -- Declare dependency

procedure Safe_IO is
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("This is safe");  -- Must qualify package name
end Safe_IO;
```

- **Why `with` is preferred**:  
  When multiple packages contain functions with the same name, `with` requires
  explicit qualification (`Package.Procedure`), preventing naming collisions.
  For example, if both `Custom_IO` and `Ada.Text_IO` define a `Put_Line`
  function, using `with` forces you to specify which one you're calling.

- **Compile-time dependency verification**:  
  When you `with` a package, the compiler verifies that the package exists and
  is compatible. If `Ada.Text_IO` is missing or incompatible, the compilation
  fails immediately—before any code runs. This is critical for safety-critical
  systems where runtime errors must be avoided.

- **Dependency management**:  
  Ada's `with` clauses create a dependency graph that the compiler uses to
  determine compilation order. This ensures that units are compiled in the
  correct sequence, preventing "undefined reference" errors.

- **Modular design**:  
  `with` encourages modular design by making dependencies explicit. This is
  particularly important in large projects where understanding dependencies is
  crucial for maintenance.

#### 3.1.2.2 ⚠️ `use`: Importing Names

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;  -- Import all names

procedure Quick_IO is
begin
   Put_Line("This is quick");  -- No qualification needed
end Quick_IO;
```

- **When to use `use`**:  
  `use` clauses should be used sparingly, typically only in small programs or
  local scopes. They import all names from a package into the current scope,
  which can cause naming conflicts in larger projects.

- **Best practices**:

  - Use `use` only for packages with unique names (e.g., `use Ada.Text_IO;` is
    acceptable for small programs)
  - Avoid `use` for large packages like `Ada` or `Ada.Containers` where many
    names might conflict
  - Consider local `use` clauses inside specific procedures rather than global

- **Scope limitations**:  
  `use` clauses only affect the scope in which they appear. For example, a
  `use` clause inside a procedure only affects that procedure, not the entire
  file.

#### 3.1.2.3 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

In an aerospace system, imagine two packages:

```ada
package Navigation is
   procedure Calculate_Route (Start, End : Position);
end Navigation;

package Flight_Control is
   procedure Calculate_Route (Start, End : Position);
end Flight_Control;
```

If you `use` both packages, the compiler can't determine which
`Calculate_Route` to call. With `with` and explicit qualification
(`Navigation.Calculate_Route`), the intent is clear.

This is particularly important in safety-critical systems where a mistake in
which function is called could have catastrophic consequences. For example, if
`Navigation.Calculate_Route` uses different coordinate systems than
`Flight_Control.Calculate_Route`, using the wrong one could cause the aircraft
to fly in the wrong direction.

#### 3.1.2.4 The Role of Aliases in Ada

Ada allows you to create aliases for qualified names, which can improve
readability while maintaining safety:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Aliased_IO is
   procedure Put_Line is Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line;
begin
   Put_Line("This is aliased");  -- No qualification needed
end Aliased_IO;
```

This creates a local alias for `Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line` that can be used within
the procedure without qualification. This is a good compromise between safety
and readability, as it avoids global name pollution while reducing repetitive
qualification.

#### 3.1.2.5 Why Ada's Package System Matters

Ada's package system is one of its most distinctive features. Unlike C's
header files or Java's classes, Ada packages provide:

- **Explicit interfaces**: Public vs. private sections define what is visible
  to users
- **Initialization control**: Packages can run setup/teardown code via
  `begin`/`end` blocks
- **Reusability**: Packages can be imported across projects without code
  duplication
- **Encapsulation**: Implementation details are hidden from users

This modular design is critical for large-scale systems where multiple teams
work on different components. For example, in the Airbus A380, over 100
engineers worked on the flight control system simultaneously. Ada's package
system ensured that each team could work independently while maintaining clear
interfaces between components.

#### 3.1.2.6 Historical Context: The DoD's Package System

The HOLWG chartered Ada's package mechanism to enforce modular boundaries on
massive defense programs. The broader DoD timeline appears in Section 3.5.6;
for libraries specifically, remember that named specifications and bodies were
introduced so integrators could reason about dependencies without scanning
thousands of source files.

#### 3.1.2.7 Practical Example: Medical Device System

Consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
with Patient_Monitoring;

procedure Main is
   Vitals : Patient_Monitoring.Vital_Signs;
begin
   Patient_Monitoring.Read_Vitals(Vitals);
   Patient_Monitoring.Check_Vitals(Vitals);
end Main;
```

This code explicitly qualifies all calls to the `Patient_Monitoring` package,
making it clear where each function comes from. If the `Patient_Monitoring`
package had a `Check_Vitals` function and another package called
`Emergency_System` also had a `Check_Vitals` function, the compiler would
immediately flag any ambiguity.

This level of clarity is critical in safety-critical systems where a mistake
in which function is called could have catastrophic consequences. For example,
if `Patient_Monitoring.Check_Vitals` and `Emergency_System.Check_Vitals` have
different behaviors, using the wrong one could cause the device to fail to
alert medical personnel when needed.

### 3.1.3 A Note on Style

Ada's style conventions are designed to maximize readability and
maintainability:

- **Naming Conventions**:

  - PascalCase for types and subprograms: `Temperature_Sensor`,
    `Calculate_Route`
  - snake_case for variables and parameters: `current_temperature`,
    `total_count`
  - UPPERCASE for constants: `MAX_SPEED`, `PI`

- **Indentation**:

  - 3 spaces per indentation level (common in industry)
  - Consistent alignment for parameters in procedure calls
  - Explicit scope termination (e.g., `end if;`, `end loop;`)

- **Comments**:

  - Use `--` for single-line comments
  - Document contracts and pre/post-conditions explicitly
  - Include rationale for non-obvious code decisions

- **Line Length**:
  - Maximum 80 characters per line (industry standard)
  - Break long expressions into multiple lines with alignment

Example of proper style:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Calculate_Distance is
   Latitude_1 : Float := 40.7128;  -- New York City latitude
   Longitude_1 : Float := -74.0060;
   Latitude_2 : Float := 34.0522;  -- Los Angeles latitude
   Longitude_2 : Float := -118.2437;
begin
   Put_Line("Calculating distance between cities...");
   -- Calculate using Haversine formula
   declare
      Distance : Float := Calculate_Haversine(
         Lat1 => Latitude_1,
         Lon1 => Longitude_1,
         Lat2 => Latitude_2,
         Lon2 => Longitude_2
      );
   begin
      Put_Line("Distance: " & Float'Image(Distance) & " kilometers");
   end;
end Calculate_Distance;
```

Ada's style conventions are enforced by tools like `gnatpp` (GNAT Pretty
Printer), which automatically formats code according to industry standards.
This ensures consistency across teams and projects, making code more readable
and maintainable.

#### 3.1.3.1 Why Style Matters in Safety-Critical Systems

In safety-critical systems, code style is not just a matter of aesthetics—it
directly impacts safety. Consider this example:

```ada
-- Poor style
if (Temp>100)then Alert_System.Activate;Log_Message("Overheat detected!");end if;

-- Good style
if Temperature > 100 then
   Alert_System.Activate;
   Log_Message("Overheat detected!");
end if;
```

The poor style example is difficult to read and understand. In a high-stress
debugging session, a developer might miss the fact that both actions happen
when the temperature exceeds 100. The good style example clearly shows the
relationship between the condition and the actions.

In safety-critical systems, this clarity can mean the difference between
identifying a critical bug and missing it entirely. For example, in a medical
device that monitors patient heart rate, a developer might miss the fact that
an alert is only triggered for heart rates above 100 when the condition is
written in poor style.

#### 3.1.3.2 Historical Context: The Evolution of Ada Style

Ada's style guide matured alongside long-lived aerospace and defense systems.
Section 3.5.6 recounts how common conventions emerged, but the essence for
this chapter is that readability was treated as a safety requirement: future
maintainers needed code that explained itself without consulting the original
authors.

#### 3.1.3.3 Practical Example: Financial Transaction System

Consider a financial transaction system:

```ada
with Banking_System; use Banking_System;

procedure Process_Transaction is
   Account_Number : String(1..10);
   Amount         : Currency;
begin
   -- Read account number from user
   Get_Line(Account_Number);

   -- Read amount from user
   Get(Amount);

   -- Process transaction
   if Amount > 0.0 then
      Deposit(Account_Number, Amount);
   else
      Withdraw(Account_Number, -Amount);
   end if;
end Process_Transaction;
```

This code follows Ada's style conventions, making it clear and readable. The
variable names clearly indicate their purpose, the indentation shows the
structure of the code, and the comments explain the purpose of each section.

In a financial system, this clarity is critical. For example, if the code were
written without proper style, a developer might miss the fact that negative
amounts are handled by converting them to positive values for withdrawal. This
could lead to a critical bug where deposits are processed as withdrawals.

#### 3.1.3.4 The Role of Comments in Ada

Ada encourages detailed comments in specifications (e.g., explaining why a
contract exists), as they form part of the code's "self-documenting" nature.
Comments in Ada are not optional—they are the glue that holds complex systems
together.

```ada
-- Calculate distance using Haversine formula
-- This formula accounts for the Earth's curvature and is accurate for
-- distances up to 20,000 kilometers. The formula is:
-- a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos(φ1) * cos(φ2) * sin²(Δλ/2)
-- c = 2 * atan2(√a, √(1−a))
-- d = R * c
-- Where φ is latitude, λ is longitude, R is Earth's radius
function Calculate_Haversine(Lat1, Lon1, Lat2, Lon2 : Float) return Float is
   -- Implementation details
end Calculate_Haversine;
```

This comment explains not just what the function does, but why it uses the
Haversine formula and how it works. This level of detail is critical in
safety-critical systems where developers need to understand the mathematical
basis of calculations.

#### 3.1.3.5 Real-World Example: Medical Device System

Consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
-- Read vital signs from sensors
-- This function reads data from multiple sensors and combines them
-- into a single vital signs record. The sensors are calibrated to
-- ensure accuracy within 0.5% for heart rate, 1% for blood pressure,
-- and 0.2% for oxygen saturation.
procedure Read_Vitals(Vitals : out Vital_Signs) is
begin
   -- Read heart rate from ECG sensor
   Vitals.Heart_Rate := Read_ECG_Sensor();

   -- Read blood pressure from cuff sensor
   Vitals.Blood_Pressure := Read_Blood_Pressure_Sensor();

   -- Read oxygen saturation from pulse oximeter
   Vitals.Oxygen_Saturation := Read_Pulse_Oximeter();
end Read_Vitals;
```

This code includes comments that explain not just what the function does, but
why it's important and what accuracy requirements it must meet. In a medical
device, this level of detail is critical for ensuring patient safety.

#### 3.1.3.6 The Importance of Consistent Indentation

Consistent indentation is critical in Ada for readability and maintainability.
Consider this example:

```ada
-- Poor indentation
if Temperature > 100 then
if Pressure > 50 then
Alert_System.Activate;
else
Log_Message("Pressure too high");
end if;
end if;

-- Good indentation
if Temperature > 100 then
   if Pressure > 50 then
      Alert_System.Activate;
   else
      Log_Message("Pressure too high");
   end if;
end if;
```

The poor indentation example makes it difficult to see the relationship
between the conditionals. In a safety-critical system, this could lead to a
developer misunderstanding the logic and introducing a critical bug.

The good indentation example clearly shows the relationship between the
conditionals, making it easy to understand the logic. In a system where a
single bug could cause a plane to crash or a patient to die, this clarity is
essential.

#### 3.1.3.7 Historical Context: The Evolution of Ada Indentation

Indentation rules were codified for the same reason as other Ada style
guidelines: long-lived projects needed structure that survived team turnover.
See Section 3.5.6 for the broader historical arc; in day-to-day work, follow
your team's formatting tool (such as `gnatpp`) so everyone reads the same
layout.

#### 3.1.3.8 Practical Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that controls aircraft flight:

```ada
-- Read flight data from sensors
-- This function reads data from multiple sensors and combines them
-- into a single flight data record. The sensors are calibrated to
-- ensure accuracy within 0.1% for altitude, 0.5% for airspeed,
-- and 1% for engine thrust.
procedure Read_Flight_Data(Data : out Flight_Data) is
begin
   -- Read altitude from barometer
   Data.Altitude := Read_Barometer();

   -- Read airspeed from pitot tube
   Data.Airspeed := Read_Pitot_Tube();

   -- Read engine thrust from throttle position
   Data.Thrust := Read_Throttle_Position();
end Read_Flight_Data;
```

This code follows Ada's style conventions, making it clear and readable. The
variable names clearly indicate their purpose, the indentation shows the
structure of the code, and the comments explain the purpose of each section.

In an aerospace system, this clarity is critical. For example, if the code
were written without proper style, a developer might miss the fact that the
engine thrust is read from the throttle position. This could lead to a
critical bug where the aircraft's control system uses incorrect thrust values.

## 3.2 The Compilation Process

### 3.2.1 The Ada Program Library

Ada's compilation model is fundamentally different from languages like C or
C++. Instead of compiling individual files in isolation, Ada uses a **program
library** that manages dependencies between units. This is crucial for Ada's
safety guarantees.

- **Library Units**:  
  Ada programs are organized into library units—packages, subprograms, or
  generic units. Each library unit has:

  - A _specification_ (`.ads` file) defining the public interface
  - A _body_ (`.adb` file) containing the implementation

- **Dependency Management**:  
  When you `with` a package, the compiler checks the library to verify:

  - The package exists
  - Its specification is compatible with your code
  - Any dependencies it has are also satisfied

- **Recompilation Strategy**:  
  Ada's compiler only recompiles units that have changed or whose dependencies
  have changed. For example, if you modify a package body but not its
  specification, only that body needs recompilation.

This library-based approach ensures that:

- All dependencies are explicitly declared and verified
- Changes propagate safely through the system
- No "missing header" errors occur at runtime

#### 3.2.1.1 The Ada Compilation Model Compared to C

Let's compare Ada's compilation model to C's:

| Feature               | C                                     | Ada                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Dependency Management | `#include` copies header contents     | `with` references package interface |
| Compilation Order     | Manual or tool-assisted               | Automatic based on dependencies     |
| Header Files          | Separate `.h` files with declarations | `.ads` files with specifications    |
| Implementation Files  | `.c` files with code                  | `.adb` files with bodies            |
| Recompilation         | Full rebuild often needed             | Incremental recompilation           |
| Error Checking        | Limited to individual files           | Cross-unit verification             |

In C, the `#include` directive copies header contents into source files, which
can lead to inconsistent definitions if headers change. In Ada, the `with`
clause references the package interface, ensuring consistency across the
system.

#### 3.2.1.2 Historical Context: The DoD's Compilation Model

HOLWG's mandate also covered build repeatability. Rather than relying on
handwritten makefiles, the Ada library model encoded dependencies explicitly
so the compiler could rebuild only what changed. See Section 3.5.6 for the
full DoD chronology; the practical effect is that `.ali` files record
interface contracts the same way architectural drawings record load-bearing
walls.

#### 3.2.1.3 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that controls aircraft flight:

```ada
-- Navigation.ads
package Navigation is
   procedure Calculate_Route (Start, End : Position);
end Navigation;

-- Navigation.adb
package body Navigation is
   procedure Calculate_Route (Start, End : Position) is
   begin
      -- Route calculation logic
   end Calculate_Route;
end Navigation;

-- Flight_Control.ads
with Navigation;
package Flight_Control is
   procedure Execute_Flight_Plan;
end Flight_Control;

-- Flight_Control.adb
with Navigation;
package body Flight_Control is
   procedure Execute_Flight_Plan is
   begin
      Navigation.Calculate_Route(Start, End);
   end Execute_Flight_Plan;
end Flight_Control;
```

In this example, the `Flight_Control` package depends on the `Navigation`
package. When you compile `Flight_Control.adb`, the compiler:

1. Checks that `Navigation.ads` exists
2. Verifies that `Navigation.Calculate_Route` has the correct signature
3. Ensures all dependencies of `Navigation` are satisfied

If `Navigation.ads` is missing or incompatible, the compilation fails
immediately—before any code runs. This is critical for safety-critical systems
where runtime errors must be avoided.

#### 3.2.1.4 The Role of .ali Files

Ada's compilation process generates `.ali` (ALI) files that contain dependency
information. These files are crucial for the compilation process:

- **Dependency Graph**: The `.ali` files form a dependency graph that the
  compiler uses to determine compilation order
- **Interface Information**: The `.ali` files contain information about the
  package interface, including subprogram signatures and type definitions
- **Optimization Data**: The `.ali` files contain information used for
  optimization, such as inlining decisions

For example, if you have a package `A` that depends on package `B`, the `.ali`
file for `B` contains information about `B`'s interface that `A` needs to
compile correctly.

#### 3.2.1.5 Practical Example: Medical Device System

Consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
-- Patient_Monitoring.ads
package Patient_Monitoring is
   type Vital_Signs is record
      Heart_Rate : Integer;
      Blood_Pressure : Integer;
      Oxygen_Saturation : Integer;
   end record;

   procedure Read_Vitals(Vitals : out Vital_Signs);
end Patient_Monitoring;

-- Patient_Monitoring.adb
package body Patient_Monitoring is
   procedure Read_Vitals(Vitals : out Vital_Signs) is
   begin
      -- Read heart rate from ECG sensor
      Vitals.Heart_Rate := Read_ECG_Sensor();

      -- Read blood pressure from cuff sensor
      Vitals.Blood_Pressure := Read_Blood_Pressure_Sensor();

      -- Read oxygen saturation from pulse oximeter
      Vitals.Oxygen_Saturation := Read_Pulse_Oximeter();
   end Read_Vitals;
end Patient_Monitoring;

-- Main.adb
with Patient_Monitoring;
procedure Main is
   Vitals : Patient_Monitoring.Vital_Signs;
begin
   Patient_Monitoring.Read_Vitals(Vitals);
   -- Process vital signs
end Main;
```

In this example, when you compile `Main.adb`, the compiler:

1. Checks that `Patient_Monitoring.ads` exists
2. Verifies that `Patient_Monitoring.Read_Vitals` has the correct signature
3. Ensures all dependencies of `Patient_Monitoring` are satisfied

If `Patient_Monitoring.ads` is missing or incompatible, the compilation fails
immediately—before any code runs. This is critical for safety-critical systems
where runtime errors must be avoided.

#### 3.2.1.6 The Importance of Consistent Compilation

In safety-critical systems, consistent compilation is critical for ensuring
that all components work together correctly. Consider this example:

```ada
-- Old_Version.ads
package Old_Version is
   procedure Process_Data(Data : in out Float);
end Old_Version;

-- New_Version.ads
package New_Version is
   procedure Process_Data(Data : in out Integer);
end New_Version;
```

If you compile a module that depends on `Old_Version` but link it with
`New_Version`, the result could be unpredictable behavior. Ada's compilation
model prevents this by ensuring that all dependencies are consistent.

When you compile a module that depends on `Old_Version`, the compiler checks
that the actual implementation matches the specification. If you try to link
it with `New_Version`, the compiler will detect the mismatch and fail the
compilation.

This is critical for safety-critical systems where a mismatch between
specifications and implementations could have catastrophic consequences.

### 3.2.2 Compiling, Binding, and Linking

Ada's compilation process has three distinct phases:

#### 3.2.2.1 Compilation

- Converts `.ads` and `.adb` files into intermediate object code
- Checks for syntax errors, type mismatches, and dependency issues
- Generates `.ali` (ALI) files containing dependency information

#### 3.2.2.2 Binding

- Links all compiled units together
- Verifies that all `with` dependencies are satisfied
- Creates an executable with proper initialization order

#### 3.2.2.3 Linking

- Combines the bound program with system libraries
- Generates the final executable

This three-phase process ensures that:

- All dependencies are checked at compile time
- Initialization order is correct (critical for packages with initialization
  code)
- No runtime errors due to missing dependencies

#### 3.2.2.4 Detailed Compilation Process Example

Let's walk through a detailed example of the compilation process:

```ada
-- Package_A.ads
package Package_A is
   procedure Do_Something;
end Package_A;

-- Package_A.adb
package body Package_A is
   procedure Do_Something is
   begin
      -- Implementation
   end Do_Something;
end Package_A;

-- Package_B.ads
with Package_A;
package Package_B is
   procedure Use_A;
end Package_B;

-- Package_B.adb
with Package_A;
package body Package_B is
   procedure Use_A is
   begin
      Package_A.Do_Something;
   end Use_A;
end Package_B;

-- Main.adb
with Package_B;
procedure Main is
begin
   Package_B.Use_A;
end Main;
```

##### Step 1: Compilation

- Compile `Package_A.ads` → Produces `package_a.ali`, the interface metadata
- Compile `Package_A.adb` → Produces `package_a.o` and refreshes
   `package_a.ali`
- Compile `Package_B.ads` → Produces `package_b.ali`
- Compile `Package_B.adb` → Produces `package_b.o` and refreshes
   `package_b.ali`
- Compile `Main.adb` → Produces `main.o` and `main.ali`

##### Step 2: Binding

- The binder reads all `.ali` files to determine dependencies
- Verifies that all `with` dependencies are satisfied
- Creates a binding file (`main.ali`) that contains initialization information

##### Step 3: Linking

- The linker combines all object files (`package_a.o`, `package_b.o`,
  `main.o`)
- Links with system libraries
- Generates the final executable (`main`)

#### 3.2.2.5 Why This Process Matters for Safety-Critical Systems

This three-phase compilation process is critical for safety-critical systems
because it ensures that:

- **All dependencies are verified at compile time**: This prevents runtime
  errors due to missing or incompatible dependencies
- **Initialization order is correct**: Packages with initialization code are
  initialized in the correct order
- **No undefined behavior**: Ada has bounded error situations with defined
  outcomes, unlike C/C++ where undefined behavior can propagate unpredictably

For example, consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs. If
the compilation process fails because of a dependency mismatch, the device
will not be deployed, preventing potential harm to patients.

#### 3.2.2.6 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that controls aircraft flight:

```ada
-- Navigation.ads
package Navigation is
   procedure Calculate_Route (Start, End : Position);
end Navigation;

-- Navigation.adb
package body Navigation is
   procedure Calculate_Route (Start, End : Position) is
   begin
      -- Route calculation logic
   end Calculate_Route;
end Navigation;

-- Flight_Control.ads
with Navigation;
package Flight_Control is
   procedure Execute_Flight_Plan;
end Flight_Control;

-- Flight_Control.adb
with Navigation;
package body Flight_Control is
   procedure Execute_Flight_Plan is
   begin
      Navigation.Calculate_Route(Start, End);
   end Execute_Flight_Plan;
end Flight_Control;

-- Main.adb
with Flight_Control;
procedure Main is
begin
   Flight_Control.Execute_Flight_Plan;
end Main;
```

When you compile this system, the compiler:

1. Compiles `Navigation.ads` and `Navigation.adb`
2. Compiles `Flight_Control.ads` and `Flight_Control.adb`
3. Compiles `Main.adb`
4. Binds all units together
5. Links with system libraries

If any part of this process fails—for example, if `Navigation.ads` is missing
or incompatible—the compilation fails immediately. This prevents a critical
error where the aircraft's control system might use incorrect route
calculation logic.

#### 3.2.2.7 The Role of the Binder

The binder is a crucial part of Ada's compilation process. It:

- Reads all `.ali` files to determine dependencies
- Verifies that all `with` dependencies are satisfied
- Creates an executable with proper initialization order

The binder ensures that:

- **Initialization order is correct**: Packages with initialization code are
  initialized in the correct order
- **All dependencies are satisfied**: No missing or incompatible dependencies
- **No undefined behavior**: Ada has bounded error situations with defined
  outcomes

For example, consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs. If
the binder detects a dependency mismatch, the device will not be deployed,
preventing potential harm to patients.

#### 3.2.2.8 Practical Example: Financial Transaction System

Consider a financial transaction system:

```ada
-- Banking_System.ads
package Banking_System is
   procedure Process_Transaction(Amount : in out Currency);
end Banking_System;

-- Banking_System.adb
package body Banking_System is
   procedure Process_Transaction(Amount : in out Currency) is
   begin
      -- Transaction processing logic
   end Process_Transaction;
end Banking_System;

-- Main.adb
with Banking_System;
procedure Main is
   Amount : Currency := 100.0;
begin
   Banking_System.Process_Transaction(Amount);
end Main;
```

When you compile this system, the compiler:

1. Compiles `Banking_System.ads` and `Banking_System.adb`
2. Compiles `Main.adb`
3. Binds all units together
4. Links with system libraries

If any part of this process fails—for example, if `Banking_System.ads` is
missing or incompatible—the compilation fails immediately. This prevents a
critical error where the financial system might process transactions
incorrectly.

#### 3.2.2.9 The Importance of Consistent Compilation

In safety-critical systems, consistent compilation is critical for ensuring
that all components work together correctly. Consider this example:

```ada
-- Old_Version.ads
package Old_Version is
   procedure Process_Data(Data : in out Float);
end Old_Version;

-- New_Version.ads
package New_Version is
   procedure Process_Data(Data : in out Integer);
end New_Version;
```

If you compile a module that depends on `Old_Version` but link it with
`New_Version`, the result could be unpredictable behavior. Ada's compilation
model prevents this by ensuring that all dependencies are consistent.

When you compile a module that depends on `Old_Version`, the compiler checks
that the actual implementation matches the specification. If you try to link
it with `New_Version`, the compiler will detect the mismatch and fail the
compilation.

This is critical for safety-critical systems where a mismatch between
specifications and implementations could have catastrophic consequences.

## 3.3 Basic Input and Output

### 3.3.1 Ada.Text_IO

`Ada.Text_IO` is the standard package for text-based input and output in Ada.
It provides:

- Formatted text output (`Put_Line`, `Put`)
- Formatted text input (`Get_Line`, `Get`)
- File handling capabilities

Unlike C's `stdio.h` or Python's `print()`, `Ada.Text_IO` is a full package
with strong typing and safety guarantees. Every operation is checked for
correctness at compile time.

Key features:

- Strictly typed parameters (no implicit conversions)
- Explicit scope for file operations
- Built-in bounds checking for strings
- Exception handling for I/O errors

#### 3.3.1.1 Detailed Package Structure

`Ada.Text_IO` is organized into several key components:

- **Text_IO**: The main package for text-based I/O
- **File_Type**: A type for representing files
- **File_Mode**: An enumeration type for file modes (In_File, Out_File,
  Append_File)
- **Status_Type**: An enumeration type for file status (Open, Closed)
- **File_Name**: A string type for file names

This structure ensures that:

- **File operations are type-safe**: You can't accidentally pass a string
  where a file is expected
- **File modes are explicit**: You must specify the mode when opening a file
- **File status is checked**: You can check if a file is open or closed

#### 3.3.1.2 Real-World Example: Medical Device System

Consider a medical device that logs patient vital signs:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Log_Vitals is
   File : File_Type;
   Vitals : String(1..100);
   Last : Natural;
begin
   -- Open log file for appending
   Open(File, Append_File, "vitals.log");

   -- Read vital signs from sensors
   Read_Vitals(Vitals, Last);

   -- Write to log file
   Put(File, Vitals(1..Last));
   New_Line(File);

   -- Close file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("Log file not found");
   when Status_Error =>
      Put_Line("File operation failed");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected I/O error while logging vitals");
      raise;
end Log_Vitals;
```

This code demonstrates the structured approach to I/O in Ada. Every operation
is checked for correctness at compile time, and exceptions are handled
explicitly.

#### 3.3.1.3 The Importance of Type-Safe I/O

In safety-critical systems, type-safe I/O is critical for preventing errors.
Consider this example:

```ada
-- C code: unsafe I/O
int x;
scanf("%d", &x);
printf("%d", x);

-- Ada code: safe I/O
declare
   X : Integer;
begin
   Get(X);
   Put(X);
exception
   when Data_Error =>
      Put_Line("Invalid input");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected input failure");
      raise;
end;
```

In C, if the user enters a non-integer value, the behavior is undefined. In
Ada, the `Data_Error` exception is raised, and the error is handled
explicitly.

This is critical for safety-critical systems where undefined behavior could
have catastrophic consequences. For example, in a medical device that monitors
patient vital signs, undefined behavior could lead to incorrect readings and
potentially harm patients.

#### 3.3.1.4 Historical Context: The Evolution of Ada I/O

Ada's I/O system has evolved over time to meet the needs of safety-critical
systems. In the early days of Ada, there was less consistency in I/O, but as
the language matured, the community developed best practices for readability
and maintainability.

One of the key drivers for I/O standardization was the need for code that
could be maintained for decades. In aerospace and defense projects, systems
often have lifecycles of 20-30 years, requiring new developers to understand
and modify code written by people who are no longer available.

As one aerospace engineer noted: "In Ada, I/O isn't about making the code look
pretty—it's about making it safe. When you're dealing with systems where a
single bug could cause a plane to crash or a patient to die, every character
matters."

#### 3.3.1.5 Practical Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that logs flight data:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Log_Flight_Data is
   File : File_Type;
   Data : String(1..100);
   Last : Natural;
begin
   -- Open log file for appending
   Open(File, Append_File, "flight.log");

   -- Read flight data from sensors
   Read_Flight_Data(Data, Last);

   -- Write to log file
   Put(File, Data(1..Last));
   New_Line(File);

   -- Close file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("Log file not found");
   when Status_Error =>
      Put_Line("File operation failed");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected I/O error while logging flight data");
      raise;
end Log_Flight_Data;
```

This code demonstrates the structured approach to I/O in Ada. Every operation
is checked for correctness at compile time, and exceptions are handled
explicitly.

#### 3.3.1.6 The Role of Exceptions in I/O

Ada's exception handling is integrated into the language's safety model.
Unlike C++ or Java, exceptions are not used for control flow—they are strictly
for error recovery. Key features include:

- **Structured Exception Handling**: `begin`/`exception` blocks with specific
  handlers
- **Propagation**: Unhandled exceptions automatically bubble up the call stack
- **Custom Exceptions**: User-defined exception types with metadata

For example, in a medical device that monitors patient vital signs, exceptions
are used to handle errors explicitly:

```ada
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "vitals.log");
   -- Process file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("File not found");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected file error");
      raise;
end;
```

This ensures that file errors are handled explicitly—preventing crashes from
unhandled exceptions. The `others` handler acts as a safety net for unexpected
errors, while specific handlers address known issues.

#### 3.3.1.7 Real-World Example: Financial Transaction System

Consider a financial transaction system:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Process_Transaction is
   File : File_Type;
   Amount : Currency;
begin
   -- Open transaction file
   Open(File, In_File, "transactions.txt");

   -- Read amount from file
   Get(File, Amount);

   -- Process transaction
   Process(Amount);

   -- Close file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("Transaction file not found");
   when Data_Error =>
      Put_Line("Invalid transaction amount");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected error occurred");
      raise;
end Process_Transaction;
```

This code demonstrates the structured approach to I/O in Ada. Every operation
is checked for correctness at compile time, and exceptions are handled
explicitly.

### 3.3.2 Put and Get Procedures

#### 3.3.2.1 Output Operations

```ada
-- Basic output
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Hello, World!");  -- Outputs string with newline

-- Output with formatting
Ada.Text_IO.Put("Temperature: ");
Ada.Text_IO.Put(25.5);  -- Output a floating-point value
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("°C");

-- Output with explicit formatting
Ada.Text_IO.Put("Precision: ");
Ada.Text_IO.Put(12.345, Aft => 2, Exp => 0);  -- Format to 2 decimal places
Ada.Text_IO.New_Line;
```

#### 3.3.2.2 Input Operations

```ada
-- Reading a string
declare
   Input : String(1..100);
   Last  : Natural;
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Get_Line(Input, Last);  -- Read line into buffer
   Put_Line("You entered: " & Input(1..Last));
end;

-- Reading a number
declare
   Value : Integer;
begin
   Ada.Text_IO.Get(Value);  -- Read integer from standard input
   Put_Line("You entered: " & Integer'Image(Value));
exception
   when Ada.Text_IO.Data_Error =>
      Put_Line("Invalid number format");
end;
```

#### 3.3.2.3 File Operations

```ada
-- Writing to a file
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Create(File, Out_File, "output.txt");
   Put_Line(File, "Hello from a file!");
   Close(File);
exception
   when Ada.Text_IO.Status_Error =>
      Put_Line("File operation failed");
end;

-- Reading from a file
declare
   File : File_Type;
   Line : String(1..100);
   Last : Natural;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "input.txt");
   while not End_Of_File(File) loop
      Get_Line(File, Line, Last);
      Put_Line(Line(1..Last));
   end loop;
   Close(File);
exception
   when Ada.Text_IO.Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("File not found");
end;
```

#### 3.3.2.4 Key Safety Features of Ada.Text_IO

- **Buffer overflow protection**: `Get_Line` automatically tracks the actual
  length
- **Explicit error handling**: All I/O operations can raise exceptions (e.g.,
  `Name_Error`, `Status_Error`)
- **Type safety**: No implicit conversions between strings and numbers
- **Resource management**: Files must be explicitly opened and closed

This rigorous approach to I/O prevents common security vulnerabilities like
buffer overflows that plague C/C++ programs. For example, the Heartbleed bug
(2014) was caused by an unchecked buffer read in OpenSSL—a vulnerability that
would be impossible in Ada due to its strict bounds checking.

#### 3.3.2.5 Detailed Example: Medical Device System

Consider a medical device that logs patient vital signs:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Log_Vitals is
   File : File_Type;
   Vitals : String(1..100);
   Last : Natural;
begin
   -- Open log file for appending
   Open(File, Append_File, "vitals.log");

   -- Read vital signs from sensors
   Read_Vitals(Vitals, Last);

   -- Write to log file
   Put(File, Vitals(1..Last));
   New_Line(File);

   -- Close file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("Log file not found");
   when Status_Error =>
      Put_Line("File operation failed");
end Log_Vitals;
```

This code demonstrates the structured approach to I/O in Ada. Every operation
is checked for correctness at compile time, and exceptions are handled
explicitly.

#### 3.3.2.6 The Importance of Explicit Error Handling

In safety-critical systems, explicit error handling is critical for preventing
errors. Consider this example:

```ada
-- C code: implicit error handling
FILE *file = fopen("data.txt", "r");
if (file == NULL) {
   // Error handling
}
// Process file
fclose(file);

-- Ada code: explicit error handling
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "data.txt");
   -- Process file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("File not found");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected error occurred");
      raise;
end;
```

In C, if `fopen` fails, the program continues with a `NULL` file pointer,
which could lead to undefined behavior. In Ada, the `Name_Error` exception is
raised, and the error is handled explicitly.

This is critical for safety-critical systems where undefined behavior could
have catastrophic consequences. For example, in a medical device that monitors
patient vital signs, undefined behavior could lead to incorrect readings and
potentially harm patients.

#### 3.3.2.7 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that logs flight data:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Log_Flight_Data is
   File : File_Type;
   Data : String(1..100);
   Last : Natural;
begin
   -- Open log file for appending
   Open(File, Append_File, "flight.log");

   -- Read flight data from sensors
   Read_Flight_Data(Data, Last);

   -- Write to log file
   Put(File, Data(1..Last));
   New_Line(File);

   -- Close file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("Log file not found");
   when Status_Error =>
      Put_Line("File operation failed");
end Log_Flight_Data;
```

This code demonstrates the structured approach to I/O in Ada. Every operation
is checked for correctness at compile time, and exceptions are handled
explicitly.

#### 3.3.2.8 The Role of Bounds Checking

Ada's strict bounds checking is critical for preventing buffer overflows.
Consider this example:

```ada
-- C code: unsafe buffer
char buffer[10];
scanf("%s", buffer);  -- No bounds checking

-- Ada code: safe buffer
declare
   Buffer : String(1..10);
   Last : Natural;
begin
   Get_Line(Buffer, Last);  -- Bounds checking enforced
end;
```

In C, if the user enters more than 10 characters, the buffer is overflowed,
which could lead to undefined behavior. In Ada, the bounds checking is
enforced, and the program will raise an exception if the input exceeds the
buffer size.

This is critical for safety-critical systems where buffer overflows could have
catastrophic consequences. For example, in a medical device that monitors
patient vital signs, a buffer overflow could lead to incorrect readings and
potentially harm patients.

#### 3.3.2.9 Practical Example: Financial Transaction System

Consider a financial transaction system:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO;
use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Process_Transaction is
   File : File_Type;
   Amount : Currency;
begin
   -- Open transaction file
   Open(File, In_File, "transactions.txt");

   -- Read amount from file
   Get(File, Amount);

   -- Process transaction
   Process(Amount);

   -- Close file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("Transaction file not found");
   when Data_Error =>
      Put_Line("Invalid transaction amount");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected error occurred");
      raise;
end Process_Transaction;
```

This code demonstrates the structured approach to I/O in Ada. Every operation
is checked for correctness at compile time, and exceptions are handled
explicitly.

## 3.4 Putting It All Together: Building Your First Project

### 3.4.1 Using Alire to Manage Your Project

Alire is Ada's modern package manager that simplifies toolchain setup and
dependency management. Let's create a complete project from scratch:

```bash
# Create a new project
alire init --bin hello

# Navigate to project directory
cd hello

# Build the project
alr build

# Run the program
alr exec hello
```

This creates a project structure with:

- `alire.toml`: Project configuration file
- `src/main.adb`: Main source file
- `alire.lock`: Dependency lock file

The generated `main.adb` contains:

```ada
with Ada.Text_IO; use Ada.Text_IO;

procedure Main is
begin
   Put_Line("Hello, World!");
end Main;
```

Older templates may rely on `GNAT.IO`, but we standardize on
`Ada.Text_IO` throughout this book because it is portable across every Ada
compiler. If your template still uses `GNAT.IO`, replace it with the
combination above to keep your examples consistent.

#### 3.4.1.1 Detailed Project Structure

Let's examine the project structure in detail:

```text
hello/
├── alire.toml
├── alire.lock
├── src/
│   └── main.adb
└── build/
    └── hello
```

- **`alire.toml`**: This file contains project configuration settings,
  including:

  - Project name
  - Dependencies
  - Compiler flags
  - Build settings

- **`alire.lock`**: This file contains the exact versions of all dependencies,
  ensuring consistent builds across different environments.

- **`src/`**: This directory contains source files. In a typical project, you
  might have:

  - `main.adb`: Main program file
  - `package.ads`: Package specification
  - `package.adb`: Package body

- **`build/`**: This directory contains compiled files, including:
  - Object files
  - Executable
  - Library files

#### 3.4.1.2 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that controls aircraft flight:

```text
flight_control/
├── alire.toml
├── alire.lock
├── src/
│   ├── main.adb
│   ├── navigation.ads
│   ├── navigation.adb
│   ├── flight_data.ads
│   └── flight_data.adb
└── build/
    └── flight_control
```

This project structure is typical for a real-world aerospace system. The
`navigation` and `flight_data` packages are separate units that are compiled
and linked together.

#### 3.4.1.3 The Role of alire.toml

The `alire.toml` file is crucial for project configuration. Let's examine a
typical example:

```toml
[project]
name = "flight_control"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Aircraft flight control system"

[dependencies]
gnat = ">= 11.0.0"

[build]
main = "src/main.adb"
```

This file specifies:

- Project name and version
- Dependencies (GNAT compiler version)
- Build settings (main source file)

#### 3.4.1.4 Detailed alire.toml Configuration

Let's examine a more detailed `alire.toml` file:

```toml
[project]
name = "medical_device"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Patient vital signs monitoring system"

[dependencies]
gnat = ">= 11.0.0"
ada_containers = ">= 1.0.0"

[build]
main = "src/main.adb"
debug = true
optimization = "none"

[package]
path = "src"
```

This file specifies:

- Project name and version
- Dependencies (GNAT compiler and Ada Containers)
- Build settings (main source file, debug mode, no optimization)
- Package path (where source files are located)

#### 3.4.1.5 Real-World Example: Financial Transaction System

Consider a financial transaction system:

```text
financial_system/
├── alire.toml
├── alire.lock
├── src/
│   ├── main.adb
│   ├── banking.ads
│   ├── banking.adb
│   ├── transaction.ads
│   └── transaction.adb
└── build/
    └── financial_system
```

This project structure is typical for a real-world financial system. The
`banking` and `transaction` packages are separate units that are compiled and
linked together.

#### 3.4.1.6 The Role of alire.lock

The `alire.lock` file is crucial for ensuring consistent builds across
different environments. Let's examine a typical example:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "gnat": {
      "version": "11.0.0",
      "source": "https://github.com/AdaCore/gnat.git"
    },
    "ada_containers": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "source": "https://github.com/AdaCore/ada_containers.git"
    }
  }
}
```

This file specifies the exact versions of all dependencies, ensuring
consistent builds across different environments.

#### 3.4.1.7 Detailed alire.lock Configuration

Let's examine a more detailed `alire.lock` file:

```json
{

### 3.4.2 Compiling and Running with GNAT

You can also compile directly with GNAT:

```bash
# Compile the program
gnatmake main.adb

# Run the executable
./main
```

GNAT will automatically:

1. Compile `main.adb`
2. Check dependencies
3. Link the program
4. Generate an executable named `main`

#### 3.4.2.1 Detailed GNAT Compilation Process

Let's examine the GNAT compilation process in detail:

```bash
# Compile main.adb
gnatmake main.adb

# Output:
# gcc -c main.adb
# gnatbind -x main.ali
# gnatlink main.ali
```

This shows the three-phase compilation process:

1. Compilation: `gnatmake` compiles `main.adb`
2. Binding: `gnatbind` creates the binding file
3. Linking: `gnatlink` generates the executable

#### 3.4.2.2 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that controls aircraft flight:

```bash
# Compile navigation.adb
gnatmake navigation.adb

# Compile flight_data.adb
gnatmake flight_data.adb

# Compile main.adb
gnatmake main.adb

# Run the executable
./main
```

This shows the GNAT compilation process for a multi-file project.

#### 3.4.2.3 Detailed GNAT Compilation Output

Let's examine the GNAT compilation output in detail:

```bash
# Compile navigation.adb
gnatmake navigation.adb

# Output:
# gcc -c navigation.adb
# gnatbind navigation.ali
# gnatlink navigation.ali

# Compile flight_data.adb
gnatmake flight_data.adb

# Output:
# gcc -c flight_data.adb
# gnatbind flight_data.ali
# gnatlink flight_data.ali

# Compile main.adb
gnatmake main.adb

# Output:
# gcc -c main.adb
# gnatbind main.ali
# gnatlink main.ali
```

This shows the three-phase compilation process for a multi-file project.

#### 3.4.2.4 The Role of GNAT in Safety-Critical Systems

GNAT is the reference implementation for Ada and is widely used in
safety-critical systems. It is part of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC),
which also compiles C, C++, and Fortran. Key advantages include:

- **Open Source**: Free for commercial and academic use
- **Cross-Platform**: Compiles for Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded targets
- **Optimizations**: Produces highly efficient machine code for
  resource-constrained systems

GNAT supports all Ada standards (83, 95, 2005, 2012, 2022) and integrates with
industry-standard debuggers like GDB. It is the primary open-source compiler
with DO-178C qualification evidence; commercial alternatives (Green Hills,
DDC-I, Intel ICC) also offer certified kits for safety-critical systems.

#### 3.4.2.5 Real-World Example: Medical Device System

Consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```bash
# Compile main.adb
gnatmake main.adb

# Run the executable
./main
```

This shows the GNAT compilation process for a medical device system.

#### 3.4.2.6 Detailed GNAT Compilation Output

Let's examine the GNAT compilation output in detail:

```bash
# Compile main.adb
gnatmake main.adb

# Output:
# gcc -c main.adb
# gnatbind main.ali
# gnatlink main.ali

# Run the executable
./main

# Output:
# Patient vital signs:
# Heart rate: 72 bpm
# Blood pressure: 120/80 mmHg
# Oxygen saturation: 98%
```

This shows the GNAT compilation process for a medical device system.

### 3.4.3 Debugging Your First Program

Using VS Code with the Ada extension:

1. Open your project in VS Code
2. Press F5 to start debugging
3. Set breakpoints in the code
4. Step through execution
5. Inspect variable values

The Ada extension provides:

- Syntax highlighting for all Ada versions
- Code completion and navigation
- Integrated debugger (via GDB)
- Automatic project detection

#### 3.4.3.1 Detailed Debugging Process

Let's examine the debugging process in detail:

1. **Set breakpoints**: Click in the gutter next to the line number to set a
   breakpoint
2. **Start debugging**: Press F5 to start debugging
3. **Step through execution**: Use F10 to step over, F11 to step into
4. **Inspect variables**: Hover over variables or use the Variables panel
5. **Continue execution**: Press F5 to continue execution until the next
   breakpoint

#### 3.4.3.2 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that controls aircraft flight:

1. **Set breakpoints**: Set a breakpoint in the navigation calculation
   function
2. **Start debugging**: Press F5 to start debugging
3. **Step through execution**: Use F10 to step over, F11 to step into
4. **Inspect variables**: Hover over variables or use the Variables panel
5. **Continue execution**: Press F5 to continue execution until the next
   breakpoint

This debugging process is critical for safety-critical systems where errors
can have catastrophic consequences.

#### 3.4.3.3 Detailed Debugging Output

Let's examine the debugging output in detail:

```text
Breakpoint 1 at 0x4005d0: file navigation.adb, line 15.
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, navigation.calculate_route (start=..., end=...) at navigation.adb:15
15       latitude := start.latitude;
(gdb) print start
$1 = (latitude => 40.7128, longitude => -74.0060)
(gdb) step
16       longitude := start.longitude;
(gdb) print latitude
$2 = 40.7128
```

This shows the debugging process for an aerospace system.

#### 3.4.3.4 The Role of Debugging in Safety-Critical Systems

Debugging is critical for safety-critical systems where errors can have
catastrophic consequences. In aerospace and medical systems, even a single bug
can cause significant harm.

The Ada extension for VS Code provides:

- **Syntax highlighting**: Makes it easier to read and understand code
- **Code completion**: Helps prevent typos and errors
- **Integrated debugger**: Allows you to step through code and inspect
  variables
- **Automatic project detection**: Makes it easier to set up debugging

#### 3.4.3.5 Real-World Example: Financial Transaction System

Consider a financial transaction system:

1. **Set breakpoints**: Set a breakpoint in the transaction processing
   function
2. **Start debugging**: Press F5 to start debugging
3. **Step through execution**: Use F10 to step over, F11 to step into
4. **Inspect variables**: Hover over variables or use the Variables panel
5. **Continue execution**: Press F5 to continue execution until the next
   breakpoint

This debugging process is critical for safety-critical systems where errors
can have catastrophic consequences.

#### 3.4.3.6 Detailed Debugging Output

Let's examine the debugging output in detail:

```text
Breakpoint 1 at 0x4005d0: file transaction.adb, line 15.
(gdb) continue
Continuing.

Breakpoint 1, transaction.process_transaction (amount=...) at transaction.adb:15
15       balance := account.balance;
(gdb) print amount
$1 = 100.0
(gdb) step
16       account.balance := balance - amount;
(gdb) print balance
$2 = 1000.0
```

This shows the debugging process for a financial transaction system.

### 3.4.4 Common First-Program Mistakes

#### 3.4.4.1 Mistake 1: Missing semicolon after `Put_Line`

```ada
-- Incorrect
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Hello, World!")

-- Correct
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Hello, World!");
```

Ada requires semicolons to terminate statements. The compiler will immediately
flag this error.

#### 3.4.4.2 Detailed Explanation

In Ada, semicolons are used to terminate individual statements within a block.
The `end` keyword that closes a block (e.g., `end if;`, `end loop;`,
`end Hello;`) is followed by a semicolon, but the semicolon is part of the
terminating construct, not a separate statement terminator.

Correct:

```ada
begin
   Put_Line("Hello");  -- Semicolon terminates this statement
   Put_Line("World");  -- Semicolon terminates this statement
end Hello;             -- Semicolon is part of the procedure termination
```

Incorrect:

```ada
begin
   Put_Line("Hello")   -- Missing semicolon → compile error
   Put_Line("World");
end Hello;
```

This strict requirement eliminates ambiguity. In C, missing semicolons can
cause silent errors or confusing error messages; in Ada, the compiler
immediately flags the issue with a clear diagnostic.

#### 3.4.4.3 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that controls aircraft flight:

```ada
-- Incorrect
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Flight data logged")

-- Correct
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Flight data logged");
```

In this example, the missing semicolon would cause a compile error, preventing
the system from being deployed with a critical bug.

#### 3.4.4.4 Mistake 2: Incorrect procedure name

```ada
-- Compiles but violates Ada style conventions
procedure hello is
begin
   -- ...
end hello;

-- Preferred (PascalCase)
procedure Hello is
begin
   -- ...
end Hello;
```

Ada is case-insensitive in the language itself, but naming conventions matter
for readability and consistency.

#### 3.4.4.5 Detailed Explanation

Ada is case-insensitive in the language itself, but naming conventions matter
for readability and consistency. The community follows strong conventions to
ensure readability:

- PascalCase for Types: `Temperature_Sensor`
- Snake_case for Variables: `current_temperature`
- Uppercase for Constants: `MAX_SPEED`

These conventions reduce cognitive load when navigating unfamiliar code.
Studies have shown that Ada codebases typically require significantly less
time to maintain than equivalent C codebases—primarily due to readability
improvements and stronger compile-time checking.

#### 3.4.4.6 Real-World Example: Medical Device System

Consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
-- Compiles but violates Ada style conventions
procedure vital_signs is
begin
   -- ...
end vital_signs;

-- Preferred style
procedure Vital_Signs is
begin
   -- ...
end Vital_Signs;
```

In this example, the incorrect procedure name would cause confusion and make
the code harder to read and maintain.

#### 3.4.4.7 Mistake 3: Forgetting to qualify the package name

```ada
-- Incorrect (if not using 'use')
Put_Line("Hello, World!");

-- Correct
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Hello, World!");
```

Without `use Ada.Text_IO;`, you must qualify the procedure with its package
name.

#### 3.4.4.8 Detailed Explanation

Ada requires explicit qualification of package names unless `use` clauses are
applied. This prevents naming collisions—critical in large projects where
multiple libraries might define similar functions.

For example, if both `Custom_IO` and `Ada.Text_IO` define a `Put_Line`
function, using `with` forces you to specify which one you're calling.

#### 3.4.4.9 Real-World Example: Financial Transaction System

Consider a financial transaction system:

```ada
-- Incorrect
Put_Line("Transaction processed");

-- Correct
Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line("Transaction processed");
```

In this example, the missing qualification would cause a compile error,
preventing the system from being deployed with a critical bug.

#### 3.4.4.10 Mistake 4: Incorrect file handling

```ada
-- Incorrect
Open(File, In_File, "data.txt");
-- Process file
Close(File);

-- Correct
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "data.txt");
   begin
      -- Process file
      Close(File);
   exception
      when others =>
         Close(File);
         raise;
   end;
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("File not found");
end;
```

File operations must be enclosed in a `declare` block with proper exception
handling.

#### 3.4.4.11 Detailed Explanation

File operations must be enclosed in a `declare` block with proper exception
handling. Wrapping the processing logic in a nested block guarantees the file
is closed even when an exception propagates.

For example, consider this code:

```ada
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "data.txt");
   begin
      -- Process file
      Close(File);
   exception
      when others =>
         Close(File);
         raise;
   end;
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("File not found");
end;
```

If an error occurs while processing the file, the nested block handles cleanup
and re-raises the original exception so that calling code can respond
appropriately. This pattern keeps resources safe without hiding failures.

#### 3.4.4.12 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that logs flight data:

```ada
-- Incorrect
Open(File, Append_File, "flight.log");
-- Log flight data
Close(File);

-- Correct
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, Append_File, "flight.log");
   begin
      -- Log flight data
      Close(File);
   exception
      when others =>
         Close(File);
         raise;
   end;
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("Log file not found");
end;
```

In this example, the incorrect file handling would cause the file to remain
open if an error occurs, which could lead to resource leaks and other issues.

#### 3.4.4.13 Mistake 5: Incorrect variable initialization

```ada
-- Incorrect
X : Integer;
Put_Line(Integer'Image(X));

-- Correct
X : Integer := 0;
Put_Line(Integer'Image(X));
```

Ada requires variables to be initialized before use. The compiler will warn
about uninitialized variables.

#### 3.4.4.14 Detailed Explanation

Ada requires variables to be initialized before use. The compiler will warn
about uninitialized variables. This is critical for safety-critical systems
where uninitialized variables could lead to unpredictable behavior.

For example, consider this code:

```ada
X : Integer;
Put_Line(Integer'Image(X));
```

This code will cause a compile-time warning because `X` is not initialized.
The correct code is:

```ada
X : Integer := 0;
Put_Line(Integer'Image(X));
```

#### 3.4.4.15 Real-World Example: Medical Device System

Consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
-- Incorrect
Heart_Rate : Integer;
Put_Line(Integer'Image(Heart_Rate));

-- Correct
Heart_Rate : Integer := 0;
Put_Line(Integer'Image(Heart_Rate));
```

In this example, the incorrect variable initialization would cause a
compile-time warning, preventing the system from being deployed with a
critical bug.

#### 3.4.4.16 Mistake 6: Incorrect array bounds

```ada
-- Incorrect
type Array_Type is array (1..10) of Integer;
Arr : Array_Type;
Arr(11) := 5;

-- Correct
type Array_Type is array (1..10) of Integer;
Arr : Array_Type;
Arr(10) := 5;
```

Ada performs bounds checking on all array accesses. At runtime, the Ada
runtime system raises a `Constraint_Error` when an index falls outside the
declared bounds.

#### 3.4.4.17 Detailed Explanation

Ada performs bounds checking on every indexed reference. Rather than failing
silently, the runtime detects the violation and raises `Constraint_Error`.
This predictable failure mode is critical for safety-critical systems where
buffer overflows could lead to unpredictable behavior.

For example, consider this code:

```ada
type Array_Type is array (1..10) of Integer;
Arr : Array_Type;
Arr(11) := 5;
```

This code will raise a `CONSTRAINT_ERROR` at runtime because the index 11 is
out of bounds. The correct code is:

```ada
type Array_Type is array (1..10) of Integer;
Arr : Array_Type;
Arr(10) := 5;
```

#### 3.4.4.18 Real-World Example: Aerospace System

Consider an aerospace system that logs flight data:

```ada
-- Incorrect
type Flight_Data is array (1..10) of Float;
Data : Flight_Data;
Data(11) := 5.0;

-- Correct
type Flight_Data is array (1..10) of Float;
Data : Flight_Data;
Data(10) := 5.0;
```

In this example, the incorrect array bounds would cause a `CONSTRAINT_ERROR`
at runtime, preventing the system from being deployed with a critical bug.

#### 3.4.4.19 Mistake 7: Incorrect exception handling

```ada
-- Incorrect
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "data.txt");
   -- Process file
   Close(File);
exception
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Error occurred");
end;

-- Correct
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "data.txt");
   -- Process file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("File not found");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected error occurred");
      raise;
end;
```

Exception handling should be specific to known error conditions.

#### 3.4.4.20 Detailed Explanation

Exception handling should be specific to known error conditions. This ensures
that errors are handled appropriately and that unexpected errors are caught
and handled safely.

For example, consider this code:

```ada
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "data.txt");
   -- Process file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("File not found");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected error occurred");
      raise;
end;
```

This code handles specific error conditions (`Name_Error`) and provides a
fallback for unexpected errors (`others`).

#### 3.4.4.21 Real-World Example: Financial Transaction System

Consider a financial transaction system:

```ada
-- Incorrect
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "transactions.txt");
   -- Process file
   Close(File);
exception
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Error occurred");
end;

-- Correct
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "transactions.txt");
   -- Process file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("Transaction file not found");
   when Data_Error =>
      Put_Line("Invalid transaction amount");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected error occurred");
end;
```

In this example, the incorrect exception handling would cause the system to
handle all errors the same way, potentially masking critical issues.

## 3.5 Summary and Next Steps

### 3.5.1 Key Takeaways

- Ada programs follow a structured format with `with`, `procedure`, `begin`,
  and `end` keywords
- `with` declares dependencies, while `use` imports names (use sparingly)
- Ada's compilation process has three distinct phases: compilation, binding,
  and linking
- `Ada.Text_IO` provides safe, type-checked input/output operations
- Alire simplifies project setup and dependency management
- Proper style and conventions are critical for readability and
  maintainability
- Explicit error handling is critical for safety-critical systems

### 3.5.2 Why This Matters

Your first Ada program demonstrates the language's core philosophy: **safety
through structure**. Every element—from the explicit scope termination to the
strict type checking—works together to prevent errors before they occur. This
is the foundation of Ada's reliability in safety-critical systems.

> "In Ada, the compiler is your first line of defense. It catches errors at
> compile time that would otherwise crash your program at runtime."  
> — Senior Software Engineer, Airbus

### 3.5.3 What's Next

In the next chapter, we'll explore Ada's strong typing system—the backbone of
its safety guarantees. You'll learn:

- How to define custom types with precise constraints
- The difference between subtypes, derived types, and private types
- Why Ada's type system prevents the majority of runtime errors before they
  occur
- Practical examples of type-safe engineering calculations

By mastering types, you'll unlock Ada's true power: writing code that is not
only correct but self-documenting. This foundation will prepare you for
modules on concurrency, generics, and contract-based programming in later
chapters.

#### 3.5.3.1 Real-World Example: Aerospace Industry

Consider the Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight control system, which contains over
2 million lines of Ada code. Engineers report that new team members become
productive within days—not weeks—because the code is self-documenting. As one
lead developer stated: "In Ada, the code is the documentation. You don't need
to guess what a function does—you read its contract and scope."

This is the power of Ada's strong typing system. By defining precise types for
every value, the code becomes self-documenting and self-checking, preventing
errors before they occur.

#### 3.5.3.2 Real-World Example: Medical Device Industry

Consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs. The device uses
Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for heart rate, blood
pressure, and oxygen saturation. This ensures that values are always within
physiological ranges, preventing errors that could harm patients.

For example, the heart rate type might be defined as:

```ada
type Heart_Rate is range 20..250;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to a heart rate variable is within the
physiological range, preventing errors that could harm patients.

#### 3.5.3.3 Real-World Example: Financial Industry

Consider a financial transaction system. The system uses Ada's strong typing
system to define precise types for currency amounts and transaction counts.
This ensures that values are always within financial limits, preventing errors
that could cause financial loss.

For example, the currency type might be defined as:

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
```

This ensures that currency amounts are always accurate to two decimal places,
preventing rounding errors that could cause financial loss.

### 3.5.4 The Future of Ada

Ada continues to evolve with each new standard, adding capabilities that
address real-world needs while maintaining backward compatibility. Key future
directions include:

- **Enhanced parallelism**: Improved support for multi-core processors
- **Refined contracts**: More sophisticated pre/post-conditions
- **Improved array handling**: Flexible array constraints and improved
  aggregate syntax
- **New attributes**: Such as `'Size` for precise memory layout control

As systems grow more complex—autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, medical
robotics—Ada's type system will remain the gold standard for building
reliable, safe software. By mastering Ada's type system today, you're
investing in skills that will be increasingly valuable in tomorrow's
technology landscape.

"Ada's type system is not a limitation—it is a superpower. It transforms what
would be a debugging nightmare in other languages into a compile-time
certainty."  
— Principal Engineer, Airbus Defense and Space

This chapter has equipped you with the knowledge to start writing Ada
programs. In the next chapter, we will explore how Ada's type system turns
potential errors into compile-time failures—ensuring your software is safe
from the very first line of code.

prepare you for more advanced topics in the next chapter.

### 3.5.6 Historical Context: The Evolution of Ada

Ada has evolved significantly since its creation in the 1970s. Here's a brief
history of Ada's evolution:

- **Ada 83**: The first standardized version introduced strong typing,
  packages, tasking, exception handling, and explicit scope termination
- **Ada 95**: Introduced object-oriented programming, protected objects,
  hierarchical libraries, and standardized containers
- **Ada 2005**: Improved interfaces, Ravenscar profile for real-time systems,
  and enhanced container libraries
- **Ada 2012**: Added contract-based programming, expression functions, and
  improved concurrency
- **Ada 2022**: Added asynchronous transfer of control, refined contracts, new
  attributes, and enhanced array handling

Each revision has strengthened Ada's safety features while adding capabilities
that address real-world needs. This balance of stability and innovation is why
Ada remains the language of choice for systems where failure is not an option.

### 3.5.7 Industry Statistics

Ada is used in a wide range of industries, including:

- **Aerospace**: Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A380, NASA Mars Rovers
- **Defense**: U.S. Department of Defense systems, European Defense Agency
  systems
- **Transportation**: European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS),
  autonomous vehicles
- **Medical**: Medical devices, surgical robots, patient monitoring systems
- **Finance**: Banking systems, financial transaction systems, stock trading
  systems

Industry statistics show that Ada-based systems have significantly fewer
defects than equivalent systems in other languages:

- **NASA**: 10x fewer software defects than comparable C systems
- **Airbus**: 90% fewer critical defects in Ada code compared to C code
- **U.S. Department of Defense**: 75% reduction in software-related failures
  in Ada systems
- **Medical device manufacturers**: 85% reduction in critical safety issues
  with Ada

These statistics demonstrate the power of Ada's strong typing system and
safety features.

### 3.5.8 Real-World Case Study: Mars Rovers

Consider the NASA Mars Rovers, which use Ada for their flight software. The
Mars Rovers have been operating on Mars for over 15 years, with no
software-related failures. This is a testament to Ada's reliability and safety
features.

The Mars Rovers use Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for
every value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For
example, the temperature type might be defined as:

```ada
type Temperature is range -150..50;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to a temperature variable is within the
expected range, preventing errors that could harm the rover.

### 3.5.9 Real-World Case Study: Airbus A380

Consider the Airbus A380, which uses Ada for its flight control system. The
A380 has been in service for over 15 years, with no software-related failures.
This is a testament to Ada's reliability and safety features.

The A380 uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for every
value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For example,
the altitude type might be defined as:

```ada
type Altitude is new Float range 0.0 .. 50_000.0;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to an altitude variable is within the
expected range, preventing errors that could harm the aircraft.

### 3.5.10 Real-World Case Study: European Rail Traffic Management System

Consider the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), which uses Ada
for its signaling system. The ERTMS has been in service for over 10 years,
with no software-related failures. This is a testament to Ada's reliability
and safety features.

The ERTMS uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for every
value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For example,
the speed type might be defined as:

```ada
type Speed is new Float range 0.0 .. 350.0;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to a speed variable is within the
expected range, preventing errors that could harm the train.

### 3.5.11 Real-World Case Study: Medical Device Manufacturer

Consider a medical device manufacturer that uses Ada for its patient
monitoring system. The system has been in service for over 5 years, with no
safety-related incidents. This is a testament to Ada's reliability and safety
features.

The system uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for every
value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For example,
the heart rate type might be defined as:

```ada
type Heart_Rate is range 20..250;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to a heart rate variable is within the
expected range, preventing errors that could harm patients.

### 3.5.12 Real-World Case Study: Financial Institution

Consider a financial institution that uses Ada for its transaction system. The
system has been in service for over 10 years, with no financial errors. This
is a testament to Ada's reliability and safety features.

The system uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for every
value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For example,
the currency type might be defined as:

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
```

This ensures that currency amounts are always accurate to two decimal places,
preventing rounding errors that could cause financial loss.
