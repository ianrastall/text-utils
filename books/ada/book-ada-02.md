## 2.1 The Philosophy of Ada's Type System

Ada's type system is fundamentally different from most programming languages.
While many languages treat types as mere data containers, Ada treats types as
**formal specifications of intent**. This philosophy—where types are not just
about storage but about meaning—forms the bedrock of Ada's reliability
guarantees. This section explores how Ada's type system prevents errors before
they occur, rather than merely detecting them at runtime.

### 2.1.1 Ada's Core Principle: Preventing Errors, Not Just Finding Them

Ada's design philosophy centers on **correctness by construction**. Rather
than relying on runtime checks or extensive testing to catch errors, Ada's
type system is engineered to catch mistakes _before_ code ever executes. This
isn't a luxury—it's a necessity for systems where a single error can cost
lives, millions of dollars, or entire missions.

Consider a simple example in C:

```c
// C code: accidentally adding meters to feet
int meters = 10;
int feet = 32;
int total = meters + feet; // Compiles, but is physically incorrect
```

This code compiles without error, but the result is physically meaningless. In
Ada, this mistake is impossible:

```ada
type Meters is new Integer;
type Feet is new Integer;

Distance : Meters := 10;
Height : Feet := 32;

-- This line fails to compile:
Distance := Distance + Height; -- Error: incompatible types for "+" operator
```

The Ada compiler rejects this immediately, forcing the developer to explicitly
convert units. This is not a limitation—it's a safety feature. As Jean
Ichbiah, Ada's chief designer, noted: _"Ada 83 was designed to catch errors at
compile time rather than runtime. This was not a luxury—it was a necessity for
systems where a single bug could cost lives."_

Ada's approach to type safety has its roots in the 1970s "software crisis"
when the U.S. Department of Defense recognized that inconsistent programming
practices across military projects were causing costly failures. The High-Order
Language Working Group (HOLWG) was formed to address these systemic
issues, and Ada emerged as the solution—a language designed specifically for
high-integrity systems where reliability is non-negotiable.

**The Historical Context of Strong Typing**: Before Ada, most programming
languages treated types as flexible containers where data could be freely
manipulated. C, for example, allows implicit conversions between types, which
can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to detect. The Therac-25 radiation
therapy machine disasters (1985-1987) demonstrated the catastrophic
consequences of insufficient software reliability measures—race conditions,
missing interlocks, and inadequate fault detection combined to produce fatal
overdoses. These incidents reinforced the prescience of Ada's emphasis on
compile-time safety checks.

**Modern Relevance**: In today's world of autonomous vehicles, medical
devices, and aerospace systems, the stakes are higher than ever. A single
type-related error in a self-driving car's perception system could lead to a
fatal accident. Ada's type system provides the rigorous framework needed to
prevent such scenarios.

### 2.1.2 The Concept of "Strong Typing"

In Ada, strong typing means more than just preventing implicit conversions. It
means **types carry semantic meaning** and enforce constraints that reflect
real-world requirements. A type in Ada is not just a container for bits—it's a
statement about what the data represents and how it should be used.

For example, consider a temperature sensor that only produces values between
-40°C and +85°C. In most languages, you'd simply use a floating-point variable
and hope developers remember the constraints:

```python
# Python: no type enforcement
temperature = 150.0  # Physically impossible for this sensor!
```

In Ada, you define a type that _enforces_ this constraint:

```ada
type Sensor_Temperature is range -40..85;
Current_Temp : Sensor_Temperature := 150; -- Compile-time error
```

This isn't just about preventing invalid values—it's about making the code
**self-documenting**. When a developer sees `Sensor_Temperature`, they
immediately understand the physical meaning of the data, without needing
external documentation.

**Type Safety in Real-World Systems**: In a medical device that monitors heart
rate, the difference between a valid heart rate of 60 beats per minute and an
invalid reading of 6000 beats per minute could mean life or death. Ada's type
system ensures that such invalid values cannot be accidentally assigned:

```ada
type Heart_Rate is range 20..250;
Current_Heart_Rate : Heart_Rate := 6000; -- Compile-time error
```

This level of safety is critical in systems where a single error could have
catastrophic consequences. Unlike languages that rely on runtime checks, Ada
catches these errors at the earliest possible stage—during compilation.

**The Evolution of Strong Typing**: While modern languages like Rust and
TypeScript have adopted some strong typing concepts, Ada pioneered many of
these ideas decades ago. Ada 83 (the first standardized version) introduced
strong typing as a core feature, long before it became a common practice in
other languages. This forward-thinking design has allowed Ada to remain
relevant for over 40 years, even as newer languages emerge.

### 2.1.3 A Comparison with Other Languages

Ada's approach to type safety differs significantly from mainstream languages.
Let's examine three common examples:

#### C: Weak Typing and Undefined Behavior

C's type system is weakly typed, allowing implicit conversions and undefined
behavior. Consider array bounds:

| Scenario            | C Code                                           | Ada Code                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Array out-of-bounds | `int arr[10]; arr[15] = 5;` (undefined behavior) | `type Int_Array is array (1..10) of Integer; Arr : Int_Array; Arr(15) := 5;` (raises `CONSTRAINT_ERROR`) |

In C, out-of-bounds access might crash, corrupt memory, or appear to
work—depending on the platform. In Ada, the error is guaranteed to be caught
either at compile time (for constant indices) or at runtime with a clear
exception. When the index value is computed at runtime, Ada simply defers the
check until execution, still raising `CONSTRAINT_ERROR` rather than allowing
undefined behavior.

**Historical Context**: The Heartbleed bug (2014) was caused by an unchecked
buffer read in OpenSSL—a vulnerability that allowed attackers to steal
sensitive information from servers. This bug could have been prevented by
Ada's strict array bounds checking, which would have raised a
`CONSTRAINT_ERROR` at runtime. In contrast, C's undefined behavior left the
vulnerability uncaught until exploitation occurred.

#### Python: Dynamic Typing and Runtime Errors

Python's dynamic typing shifts type checking to runtime, requiring extensive
testing to catch errors:

```python
# Python: no compile-time type checking
def calculate_speed(distance: float, time: float) -> float:
    return distance / time

# Later in code...
result = calculate_speed("100", 5)  # Runs but crashes at runtime
```

In Ada, this mistake would be caught at compile time:

```ada
function Calculate_Speed (Distance : Float; Time : Float) return Float is
begin
   return Distance / Time;
end Calculate_Speed;

-- Later in code...
Result := Calculate_Speed ("100", 5.0); -- Compile-time error: string not convertible to Float
```

**Real-World Impact**: NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter mission failure (1999) was
caused by a unit conversion error between metric and imperial units in a
ground-control component written in C/C++. Without distinct unit types, the
bug went undetected until after integration. Ada's approach—forcing developers
to create distinct types for different units—would have required an explicit
conversion and flagged the mismatch early. Dynamic languages like Python can
now be augmented with optional static analysis tools (e.g., `mypy` or
`pydantic`) to catch similar inconsistencies, but that safety net depends on
discipline, whereas Ada bakes it into the core language model:

```ada
type Metric_Force is new Float;
type Imperial_Force is new Float;

-- This would fail to compile:
Metric_Force := Imperial_Force (10.0); -- Error: incompatible types
```

#### Java: Object-Oriented Typing with Guard Rails You Build

Java has a strong static type system, yet it relies on developers to layer
domain-specific constraints on top of primitives. Consider a temperature
range:

```java
// Java: no built-in range enforcement
int temperature = 150; // Compiles, even though it's outside expected range
```

In Ada, you can define a type with precise constraints:

```ada
type Temperature is range -50..150;
Current_Temp : Temperature := 151; -- Compile-time error
```

Even more critically, Java's type system doesn't automatically prevent unit
mix-ups. In an aviation system, you might accidentally pass a speed in knots
to a function expecting meters per second unless you wrap each unit in its
own class or value object—something Ada enforces with distinct types.

### 2.1.4 The Historical Evolution of Strong Typing in Ada

Ada's strong typing wasn't an accident—it was a deliberate design choice born
from decades of experience with software failures. Let's explore how this
evolved:

**Ada 83**: The first standardized version introduced strong typing as a core
feature. This included:

- Distinct types for different units (meters vs. feet)
- Range constraints for numeric types
- Enumeration types for discrete values
- Array bounds checking

**Ada 95**: This revision strengthened Ada's type system with:

- Tagged types for object-oriented programming while preserving type safety
- Protected types for safe concurrency
- Hierarchical libraries with strong type boundaries

**Ada 2005**: Introduced improvements to:

- The Ravenscar profile for real-time systems with predictable type behavior
- Enhanced container libraries with compile-time type safety

**Ada 2012**: Added contract-based programming with:

- Pre- and post-conditions that work with the type system
- Type invariants that ensure data consistency

**Ada 2022**: Further refined:

- Contract support for anonymous types
- Enhanced array handling with flexible constraints
- Improved support for parallelism with type-safe concurrency

This evolutionary path demonstrates how Ada's type system has continuously
improved while maintaining backward compatibility—a testament to its robust
design. Unlike many languages that introduce breaking changes with new
versions, Ada's type system has evolved incrementally, allowing legacy systems
to safely adopt new features without rewriting their entire codebase.

## 2.2 Defining Custom Types with Precise Constraints

Ada's type system gives developers unprecedented control over data
representation. This section explores how to define types that precisely match
real-world requirements, from simple ranges to complex data structures.

### 2.2.1 The `type` Declaration: The Foundation of Ada's Type System

The `type` declaration is Ada's primary mechanism for creating new types.
Unlike C's `typedef` or Java's classes, Ada's types are **first-class
citizens** that can carry constraints, operations, and semantics.

Basic syntax:

```ada
type New_Type is ...;
```

This creates a new, distinct type that the compiler treats as completely
separate from all other types. For example:

```ada
type Altitude_Feet is new Float;
type Airspeed_Knots is new Float;
```

These are distinct types—`Altitude_Feet` and `Airspeed_Knots` cannot be
assigned to each other without explicit conversion. This prevents the classic
"feet vs. meters" bug that caused the Mars Climate Orbiter failure in 1999.

**Type Identity and Compatibility**: In Ada, types have identity. Two types
with the same representation are still distinct if they're defined separately.
This is crucial for safety-critical systems where mixing units could be
catastrophic.

```ada
type Meters is new Float;
type Kilometers is new Float;

-- This fails to compile:
Meters := Kilometers (1.0); -- Error: incompatible types
```

This strict type identity ensures that developers must explicitly convert
between units, preventing subtle errors that might otherwise go undetected.

**Real-World Example**: In a satellite navigation system, you might define:

```ada
type Satellite_Position is record
   Latitude : Float range -90.0..90.0;
   Longitude : Float range -180.0..180.0;
   Altitude : Float range 0.0..100000.0;
end record;
```

Each field has precise constraints that reflect physical reality, preventing
impossible values from being assigned. This is far more robust than a simple
record in C or Java where any float value could be assigned to any field.

### 2.2.2 Integer Types with Range Constraints

Ada allows you to define integer types with precise ranges, ensuring values
stay within physical limits:

```ada
type Sensor_Value is range 0..100;
type Temperature_Celsius is range -50..150;
type Page_Number is range 1..1000;
```

**Compiler Enforcement**: The compiler ensures that any variable of type
`Sensor_Value` can never hold a value outside the 0..100 range, even through
arithmetic operations:

```ada
V1 : Sensor_Value := 90;
V2 : Sensor_Value := 20;

V1 := V1 + V2; -- Compile-time error: 90+20 yields 110
               -- which is outside 0..100.
```

**Runtime Checks**: If a value comes from user input or external systems, Ada
uses the `Constraint_Error` exception as a final safety net:

```ada
declare
   Input : Integer;
begin
   -- Read from user or sensor
   Input := 150;
   V1 := Sensor_Value (Input); -- Raises Constraint_Error at runtime
exception
   when Constraint_Error =>
      Put_Line ("Invalid sensor value");
end;
```

This is critical for safety-critical systems where invalid values could cause
physical damage.

**Historical Context**: The Ariane 5 rocket failure (1996) occurred because a
legacy Ada module—compiled without range checks as a performance optimization
for a previous mission—raised an exception when reused under a different
flight profile. The exception itself was the correct signal that data had
exceeded expected bounds; the failure stemmed from the process decisions to
disable checks and to let the exception propagate into mission-critical code.
The incident underscores that Ada's tools must be paired with rigorous
validation and configuration discipline, and later Ada standards reinforced
these practices with stronger guidance on exception handling and range
constraints.

**Advanced Range Constraints**: Ada allows for more sophisticated range
specifications:

```ada
type Sensor_Threshold is range 0.0..100.0 delta 0.1;
```

This specifies a floating-point type with a step size of 0.1, ensuring values
are always multiples of 0.1. This is particularly valuable for sensor readings
where precision matters.

### 2.2.3 Floating-Point Types with Accuracy Constraints

Ada provides precise control over floating-point precision:

```ada
type Voltage is digits 6 range 0.0..12.0;
type Pressure is digits 8 range 0.0..1000.0;
```

Here, `digits 6` specifies the minimum number of significant decimal digits of
precision. This guarantees accuracy that standard `Float` types in other
languages do not.

**Why this matters**: In scientific and engineering applications,
floating-point precision matters. Consider a financial system that uses
standard `Float` for currency calculations:

```ada
-- Standard Float (inaccurate)
Amount : Float := 0.1 + 0.2;
Put_Line (Float'Image (Amount)); -- Outputs 0.30000001192092896
```

With Ada's fixed-point types (more on these in Section 2.5.3), you can
guarantee exact decimal representation:

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
Amount : Currency := 0.01 + 0.02;
Put_Line (Ada.Strings.Fixed.Trim (Currency'Image (Amount), Ada.Strings.Both)); -- Outputs "0.03"
```

This precision holds because the chosen `delta` (0.01) is exactly
representable for a decimal fixed-point type. More broadly, Ada keeps
fixed-point arithmetic exact when the `delta` matches the representation rules
for the category—powers of ten for decimal fixed point or powers of two for
ordinary fixed point. Otherwise, the language applies well-defined rounding
rather than silently losing track of precision.

**Fixed-Point vs. Floating-Point**: Ada distinguishes between two types of
numeric types:

- **Floating-point types**: For scientific calculations where precision varies
- **Fixed-point types**: For precise decimal representation (e.g., currency)

This distinction is crucial for financial systems where even small rounding
errors can accumulate to millions of dollars over time.

**Real-World Example**: In a medical device that monitors blood glucose
levels, precision matters:

```ada
type Blood_Glucose is digits 4 range 0.0..500.0;
Current_Level : Blood_Glucose := 150.0;
```

This type ensures that glucose readings are accurate to four decimal places,
which is critical for patient safety.

### 2.2.4 Enumeration Types: A Closed Set of Values

Enumeration types define a fixed set of possible values:

```ada
type Color is (Red, Green, Blue);
type System_State is (Idle, Running, Paused, Error);
type Communication_Protocol is (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP);
```

**Type Safety**: Variables of this type can only hold one of the defined
values:

```ada
My_Color : Color := Red;
My_Color := "Yellow"; -- Compile-time error: invalid value
```

**Use Cases**: Enumeration types are perfect for system states, communication
protocols, or any discrete set of options. Consider a flight control system:

```ada
type Flight_Mode is (Takeoff, Cruise, Landing, Emergency);
Current_Mode : Flight_Mode := Cruise;

-- Attempting to assign an invalid state is impossible
Current_Mode := "Unknown"; -- Error: unknown value
```

This eliminates entire classes of errors where invalid states might cause
system failures.

**Advanced Enumeration Features**: Ada allows for more sophisticated
enumeration types:

```ada
type Traffic_Light is (Red, Yellow, Green) with
   Size => 2; -- Suggests a 2-bit layout, yet the compiler may still allocate
               -- a full byte because Size is only a representation hint
```

This specifies that the type should use exactly 2 bits of storage, which is
valuable for embedded systems with memory constraints.

**Real-World Example**: In an industrial control system for a chemical plant:

```ada
type Valve_State is (Closed, Opening, Open, Closing) with
   Size => 2;
```

This ensures that the valve state can only be one of four valid values,
preventing invalid states that could cause dangerous conditions.

### 2.2.5 Array Types with Flexible and Constrained Indices

Ada provides sophisticated array types with built-in bounds checking:

**Constrained Arrays** (fixed size):

```ada
type Temperature_Array is array (1..24) of Float;
-- Must have exactly 24 elements
```

**Unconstrained Arrays** (flexible size):

```ada
type Day_Of_Week is array (Positive range <>) of Boolean;
-- Can be initialized with any positive index range
Weekdays : Day_Of_Week (1..5) := (True, True, True, True, True);
Weekend : Day_Of_Week (6..7) := (False, False);
```

**Bounds Checking**: Ada performs runtime bounds checking on all array
accesses:

```ada
Temp : Temperature_Array := (others => 0.0);
Temp(25) := 25.0; -- Raises CONSTRAINT_ERROR at runtime
```

This prevents buffer overflows—a common source of security vulnerabilities in
C/C++ programs. For example, the Heartbleed bug (2014) was caused by an
unchecked buffer read in OpenSSL—something Ada would have prevented through
its strict array bounds checking.

**Multi-Dimensional Arrays**: Ada supports multi-dimensional arrays with
precise bounds:

```ada
type Matrix is array (1..10, 1..10) of Float;
```

This ensures that every dimension has explicit bounds, preventing
out-of-bounds errors in matrix operations.

**Real-World Example**: In an aircraft flight control system:

```ada
type Flight_Data is array (1..10) of record
   Altitude : Float range 0.0..50000.0;
   Airspeed : Float range 0.0..1000.0;
   Engine_RPM : Integer range 1000..15000;
end record;
```

This composite array-of-records type ensures that each element carries
consistent, validated data, preventing invalid states that could cause system
failures.

### 2.2.6 Record Types for Structured Data

Record types allow you to create composite data structures with typed fields:

```ada
type Person is record
   Name : String (1..50);
   Age : Integer range 1..120;
   Height : Float range 0.0..2.5;
   Is_Employee : Boolean;
end record;
```

**Field Constraints**: Individual fields can have their own constraints,
ensuring the integrity of the entire data structure:

```ada
Person_Data : Person;
Person_Data.Age := 150; -- Compile-time error: Age must be 1-120
```

This is particularly valuable for complex data structures like aircraft
telemetry:

```ada
type Flight_Data is record
   Altitude : Altitude_Feet;
   Airspeed : Airspeed_Knots;
   Engine_RPM : Positive range 1000..15000;
   Fuel_Level : Fuel_Level;
end record;
```

Each field has its own precise constraints, preventing invalid combinations
that could lead to system failures.

**Record Extensions**: Ada allows for record extensions that build upon
existing records:

```ada
type Extended_Flight_Data is new Flight_Data with record
   Weather_Conditions : String (1..100);
   Flight_Plan : String (1..255);
end record;
```

This creates a new record type that includes all fields from `Flight_Data`
plus additional fields, while preserving the type safety of the original.

**Real-World Example**: In a medical device for monitoring vital signs:

```ada
type Patient_Vitals is record
   Heart_Rate : Heart_Rate;
   Blood_Pressure : Float range 40.0..250.0;
   Oxygen_Saturation : Float range 0.0..100.0;
   Temperature : Sensor_Temperature;
end record;
```

Each field has precise constraints that reflect medical standards, ensuring
that invalid readings cannot be assigned.

### 2.2.7 Discriminated Records: Dynamic Structure Based on Constraints

Ada allows for record types where the structure can vary based on a
discriminant:

```ada
type Device_Type (Kind : Device_Kind) is record
   case Kind is
      when Sensor =>
         record
            Sensor_Value : Float range 0.0..100.0;
         end record;
      when Actuator =>
         record
            Actuator_Position : Integer range 0..100;
         end record;
      when Controller =>
         record
            Control_Setpoint : Float range 0.0..1.0;
         end record;
   end case;
end record;
```

This creates a single record type that can represent different kinds of
devices, with only the relevant fields present based on the discriminant
value.

**Real-World Example**: In an industrial automation system:

```ada
type Machine_Component (Type : Component_Type) is record
   case Type is
      when Motor =>
         record
            Speed : Integer range 0..10000;
            Torque : Float range 0.0..100.0;
         end record;
      when Sensor =>
         record
            Reading : Float range 0.0..100.0;
         end record;
      when Controller =>
         record
            Control_Parameter : Float range 0.0..1.0;
         end record;
   end case;
end record;
```

This ensures that each component type has only the relevant fields, preventing
invalid combinations of data.

## 2.3 The Pillars of Abstraction: Subtypes, Derived Types, and Private Types

Ada provides three powerful mechanisms for abstracting types—each serving
distinct purposes in building reliable systems. Understanding when to use each
is critical for effective Ada programming.

### 2.3.1 Subtypes: A Constrained View

A subtype is a **constrained view of an existing type**—not a new type. It
provides additional restrictions while maintaining compatibility with the base
type.

**Definition**:

```ada
subtype Page_Number is Integer range 1..1000;
subtype Valid_Temperature is Temperature_Celsius range -40..85;
```

**Key Characteristics**:

- Assignment-compatible with base type (no conversion needed)
- Compiler enforces the constraint
- Does not create a new type identity

**Use Case**: When you need to express a logical constraint on an existing
type without creating a new, incompatible one. For example:

```ada
type Index is range 1..1000;
subtype Valid_Index is Index range 1..500;

-- This is valid:
Valid_Index := 10; -- No conversion needed
```

In a database system, you might define:

```ada
subtype Record_ID is Integer range 1..1_000_000;
```

This clearly communicates the valid range for record IDs while allowing
seamless integration with existing integer-based code.

**Advanced Subtype Features**: Subtypes can also be used with floating-point
types:

```ada
subtype Precision_Float is Float range 0.0..1.0;
```

This creates a subtype that only allows values between 0.0 and 1.0, which is
useful for probabilities or normalized values.

**Real-World Example**: In a financial system:

```ada
subtype Transaction_Amount is Currency range 0.01..1000000.00;
```

This ensures that transaction amounts are always within valid financial
limits, preventing errors like negative amounts or excessively large
transactions.

### 2.3.2 Derived Types: A New and Distinct Type

A derived type is a **completely new type** that inherits the characteristics
of its parent but is treated as distinct by the compiler.

**Definition**:

```ada
type Meters is new Float;
type Kilograms is new Float;
type Seconds is new Float;
```

**Key Characteristics**:

- Not assignment-compatible with parent type (requires explicit conversion)
- Inherits all operations of parent type
- Can add new operations or override existing ones

**Quintessential Example**: Preventing unit mix-ups:

```ada
type Mass is new Float;
type Force is new Float;

-- This fails to compile:
Mass := Force; -- Error: incompatible types

-- Must explicitly convert:
Mass := Mass (Force); -- Clear indication of unit conversion
```

This is critical for engineering systems. Consider the Mars Climate Orbiter
disaster, where a spacecraft was lost because one team used imperial units
(pounds-force seconds) while another used metric (newton-seconds). In Ada,
these would be distinct types:

```ada
type Imperial_Force is new Float;
type Metric_Force is new Float;

-- Attempting to assign one to the other would fail at compile time
```

**Real-World Example**: In an aircraft navigation system:

```ada
type Latitude is new Float range -90.0..90.0;
type Longitude is new Float range -180.0..180.0;

-- This fails to compile:
Latitude := Longitude (45.0); -- Error: incompatible types
```

This prevents the subtle error of mixing latitude and longitude values, which
could cause navigation failures.

**Advanced Derived Type Features**: Derived types can also introduce
relationships between distinct units:

```ada
type Meters  is new Float;
type Seconds is new Float;
type Meters_Per_Second is new Float;

function "/" (Distance : Meters; Time : Seconds) return Meters_Per_Second is
begin
   return Meters_Per_Second (Float (Distance) / Float (Time));
end "/";
```

This allows you to define unit-aware operations that preserve type safety
across calculations. In practice, you'd usually place such operator
definitions inside the package that declares the related types so callers can
`with` a single package and gain access to the complete unit toolkit.

### 2.3.3 Private Types: The Power of Information Hiding

Private types hide implementation details while exposing a controlled
interface. This is essential for building robust abstract data types.

**Definition**:

```ada
package Stack is
   type Stack_Type is private;

   procedure Push (S : in out Stack_Type; Item : Integer);
   function Pop (S : in out Stack_Type) return Integer;
   function Is_Empty (S : Stack_Type) return Boolean;
private
   type Stack_Index is range 0..100;
   subtype Slot is Stack_Index range 1..Stack_Index'Last;
   type Storage_Array is array (Slot) of Integer;

   type Stack_Type is record
      Elements : Storage_Array := (others => 0);
      Top      : Stack_Index := 0;
   end record;
end Stack;
```

**Key Characteristics**:

- Implementation details hidden in package body
- Users can only interact via public operations
- Prevents direct manipulation of internal state

**Use Case**: Building robust abstract data types like stacks, queues, or
opaque handles to system resources. For example, a cryptographic key type:

```ada
package Crypto is
   type Key is private;

   function Generate_Key return Key;
   function Encrypt (Data : String; Key : Key) return String;
private
   type Key is array (1..32) of Character;
end Crypto;
```

Users can generate and use keys, but cannot inspect or modify the internal
representation—preventing accidental exposure of sensitive data.

**Advanced Private Type Features**: Private types can be extended with
discriminants:

```ada
package Sensor_Data is
   type Sensor_Data_Type (Kind : Sensor_Type) is private;

   procedure Read_Sensor (Data : in out Sensor_Data_Type);
private
   type Sensor_Data_Type (Kind : Sensor_Type) is record
      case Kind is
         when Temperature =>
            Value : Float;
         when Pressure =>
            Value : Float;
         when Humidity =>
            Value : Float;
      end case;
   end record;
end Sensor_Data;
```

This creates a private type that can represent different kinds of sensor data
while hiding the implementation details from users.

**Real-World Example**: In a medical device:

```ada
package Patient_Monitor is
   type Vital_Signs is private;

   procedure Read_Vitals (Vitals : in out Vital_Signs);
   function Heart_Rate (Vitals : Vital_Signs) return Heart_Rate;
private
   type Vital_Signs is record
      Heart_Rate : Heart_Rate;
      Blood_Pressure : Float range 40.0..250.0;
      Oxygen_Saturation : Float range 0.0..100.0;
   end record;
end Patient_Monitor;
```

This ensures that vital signs data can only be accessed through the provided
interface, preventing direct manipulation that could compromise patient
safety.

### 2.3.4 A Comparative Analysis: When to Use Which

Choosing the right type mechanism is critical for effective Ada programming.
Consider these scenarios:

| Scenario                                                                       | Subtype | Derived Type | Private Type |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Validating a range of an existing type (e.g., page numbers 1-100)              | ✓       | &nbsp;       | &nbsp;       |
| Preventing unit mix-ups (meters vs. feet)                                      | &nbsp;  | ✓            | &nbsp;       |
| Creating an abstract data type (stack, queue)                                  | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;       | ✓            |
| Representing physical quantities with distinct units                           | &nbsp;  | ✓            | &nbsp;       |
| Creating a constrained view of an existing type without changing compatibility | ✓       | &nbsp;       | &nbsp;       |
| Hiding implementation details while exposing operations                        | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;       | ✓            |
| Building a type with a specific storage size                                   | &nbsp;  | &nbsp;       | ✓            |
| Creating a type with custom operations                                         | &nbsp;  | ✓            | ✓            |

**Real-World Example**: A flight control system might use all three mechanisms
together:

```ada
-- Subtype for validated altitude
subtype Altitude_Feet is Float range 0.0 .. 50_000.0;

-- Derived type for distinct units
type Airspeed_Knots is new Float range 0.0 .. 1000.0;
type Mach_Number is new Float range 0.0 .. 3.0;

-- Private type for sensitive data
package Navigation_System is
   type Waypoint is private;

   procedure Add_Waypoint (W : in out Waypoint; Lat : Float; Lon : Float);
   procedure Calculate_Route (Start, End : Waypoint; Route : out Route_Array);
private
   type Waypoint is record
      Latitude : Latitude;
      Longitude : Longitude;
      Altitude : Altitude_Feet;
   end record;
end Navigation_System;
```

This structure ensures:

- Altitudes are always within valid range (subtype)
- Airspeed and Mach numbers cannot be mixed (derived types)
- Waypoint data is encapsulated and cannot be corrupted directly (private
  type)

**Advanced Example**: In a spacecraft control system:

```ada
-- Subtype for validated temperature
subtype Temperature_Celsius is Float range -270.0 .. 1000.0;

-- Derived type for distinct units
type Kelvin is new Float range 0.0 .. 1500.0;
type Fahrenheit is new Float range -450.0 .. 1832.0;

-- Private type for mission-critical data
package Spacecraft_Control is
   type Thrust_Control is private;

   procedure Set_Thrust (TC : in out Thrust_Control; Level : Float);
   function Get_Thrust (TC : Thrust_Control) return Float;
private
   type Thrust_Control is record
      Level : Float range 0.0 .. 1.0;
      Safety_Checks : Boolean;
   end record;
end Spacecraft_Control;
```

This ensures that temperature values are always valid, distinct units are
properly handled, and thrust control data is protected from direct
manipulation.

## 2.4 The Compiler as Your Guardian: Compile-Time Error Prevention

Ada's type system doesn't just prevent runtime errors—it catches errors
_before_ code is ever executed. This section explores how Ada's compiler acts
as a vigilant guardian, preventing entire classes of bugs at compile time.

### 2.4.1 Eliminating Range Errors

Ada's compiler can often detect range violations at compile time, eliminating
unnecessary runtime checks:

```ada
type Temperature is range -50..150;
Temp : Temperature := 200; -- Compile-time error
```

Even constant expressions built from literals are verified at compile time:

```ada
type Sensor_Value is range 0..100;
Valid_Value : Sensor_Value := 90;

-- This fails to compile because 90 + 20 is a constant expression that exceeds the range
-- This fails: 90 + 20 is a constant expression
-- that exceeds the declared range
Invalid_Value : Sensor_Value := 90 + 20;
```

**Off-by-One Errors**: Ada's array types with explicit bounds make off-by-one
errors nearly impossible:

```ada
type Data_Array is array (1..10) of Float;
Data : Data_Array := (others => 0.0);

-- This fails to compile:
Data(0) := 1.0; -- Index out of bounds
Data(11) := 1.0; -- Index out of bounds
```

In C, these would be undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or
security vulnerabilities. In Ada, they're caught immediately.

**Advanced Compile-Time Checks**: Ada's compiler can perform sophisticated
static analysis:

```ada
type Sensor_Value is range 0..100;
V1 : Sensor_Value := 90;
V2 : Sensor_Value := 10;

-- This compiles because 90+10=100 is within range
V1 := V1 + V2;
```

Even though the operands are variables, the compiler's static analysis can
prove this specific addition stays within bounds, allowing it to avoid an
otherwise necessary runtime check.

**Real-World Example**: In an industrial control system:

```ada
type Valve_Position is range 0..100;
Current_Position : Valve_Position := 50;
Target_Position : Valve_Position := 70;

-- This compiles because 50+20=70 is within range
Current_Position := Current_Position + 20;
```

The compiler verifies that this operation stays within valid bounds,
preventing potential equipment damage.

### 2.4.2 Preventing Accidental Unit Mix-ups

Ada's derived types create a "unit system" at compile time:

```ada
type Meters is new Float;
type Feet is new Float;

-- This fails to compile:
Distance := Meters (Feet (100.0)); -- Requires explicit conversion
```

**Real-World Examples**: The Mars Climate Orbiter disaster (1999) occurred
because one team used metric units (newtons) while another used imperial units
(pounds-force). In Ada, this would be impossible:

```ada
type Newtons is new Float;
type Pounds_Force is new Float;

-- Attempting to assign one to the other would fail at compile time
```

**Advanced Unit Conversion**: Ada allows for explicit unit conversion
functions:

```ada
function Convert_Feet_to_Meters (Feet : Feet) return Meters is
begin
   return Meters (Feet * 0.3048);
end Convert_Feet_to_Meters;
```

This ensures that unit conversions are explicit and intentional, preventing
subtle errors.

**Real-World Example**: In an aircraft navigation system:

```ada
type Latitude is new Float range -90.0..90.0;
type Longitude is new Float range -180.0..180.0;

-- This fails to compile:
Latitude := Longitude (45.0); -- Error: incompatible types

-- Must explicitly convert:
Latitude := Convert_Longitude_to_Latitude (Longitude (45.0));
```

This prevents the subtle error of mixing latitude and longitude values, which
could cause navigation failures.

### 2.4.3 Enforcing Data Integrity and Abstraction

Private types ensure that an object's internal state can only be modified
through controlled operations:

```ada
package Bank_Account is
   type Account is private;

   procedure Deposit (A : in out Account; Amount : Currency);
   procedure Withdraw (A : in out Account; Amount : Currency);
private
   type Account is record
      Balance : Currency;
      Account_ID : String (1..10);
   end record;
end Bank_Account;
```

Clients cannot directly manipulate the balance:

```ada
-- This fails to compile:
Account.Balance := 1000.0; -- Private type, cannot access directly
```

Instead, they must use the provided operations:

```ada
Deposit (My_Account, 1000.0); -- Safe, validated operation
```

This guarantees that all balance changes go through validation logic,
preventing data corruption.

**Advanced Private Type Features**: Private types can enforce complex
invariants:

```ada
package Patient_Monitor is
   type Vital_Signs is private;

   procedure Update_Vitals (Vitals : in out Vital_Signs;
                           Heart_Rate : Heart_Rate;
                           Blood_Pressure : Float);
private
   type Vital_Signs is record
      Heart_Rate : Heart_Rate;
      Blood_Pressure : Float range 40.0..250.0;
      Oxygen_Saturation : Float range 0.0..100.0;
   end record;
end Patient_Monitor;
```

This ensures that vital signs data can only be updated through the provided
interface, preventing invalid states that could compromise patient safety.

**Real-World Example**: In a medical device:

```ada
package Heart_Rate_Monitor is
   type Heart_Rate_Data is private;

   procedure Read_Data (Data : in out Heart_Rate_Data);
   function Get_Heart_Rate (Data : Heart_Rate_Data) return Heart_Rate;
private
   type Heart_Rate_Data is record
      Raw_Signal : Float range 0.0..100.0;
      Filtered_Value : Heart_Rate;
      Validation_Status : Validation_Status_Type;
   end record;
end Heart_Rate_Monitor;
```

This ensures that heart rate data is always validated and cannot be directly
manipulated, preventing errors that could lead to incorrect medical decisions.

### 2.4.4 Compile-Time Contract Verification

Ada 2012 introduced contract-based programming, which allows the compiler to
verify correctness properties at compile time:

```ada
function Divide (A : Integer; B : Integer) return Integer
  with Pre => B /= 0,
       Post => Divide'Result * B = A
is
begin
   return A / B;
end Divide;
```

Here, the `Pre` clause ensures the divisor is never zero, and the `Post`
clause guarantees the result satisfies mathematical correctness. If a caller
violates these contracts (e.g., passing `B = 0`), the compiler raises an
error—preventing runtime failures.

**Real-World Example**: In a financial system:

```ada
function Withdraw (Account : in out Account_Type; Amount : Money) return Money
  with Pre => Amount > 0.0 and Amount <= Account.Balance,
       Post => Withdraw'Result = Account.Balance'Old - Amount
is
begin
   Account.Balance := Account.Balance - Amount;
   return Account.Balance;
end Withdraw;
```

This ensures that withdrawals are always valid, preventing overdrafts and
other financial errors.

**Advanced Contract Features**: Contracts can be attached to types:

```ada
type Valid_Heart_Rate is Heart_Rate
  with Dynamic_Predicate => Valid_Heart_Rate in 30..250;
```

This ensures that any variable of type `Valid_Heart_Rate` always stays within
valid physiological ranges.

## 2.5 Practical Examples of Type-Safe Engineering

Let's examine three real-world scenarios where Ada's type system prevents
critical errors.

### 2.5.1 A Case Study: Chemical Reaction Analysis

Consider a chemical reactor control system where precise concentration and
temperature measurements are critical:

```ada
-- Define precise types for chemical parameters
type Molarity is digits 8 range 0.0 .. 10.0;
type Temperature_K is range 0 .. 500;
type Pressure_Pa is digits 6 range 0.0 .. 1_000_000.0;

-- Define type-safe functions
function Calculate_Reaction_Rate
   (Concentration : Molarity;
    Temperature : Temperature_K) return Float
is
begin
   -- TODO: implement reaction-rate kinetics for your system
   return 0.0; -- Placeholder to keep the example compilable
end Calculate_Reaction_Rate;
```

**Type-Safe Usage**:

```ada
-- Valid call
Rate := Calculate_Reaction_Rate (Conc, Temp);

-- Invalid calls (all fail at compile time):
Rate := Calculate_Reaction_Rate (Pressure, Temp); -- Wrong type
Rate := Calculate_Reaction_Rate (Conc, Pressure); -- Wrong type
Rate := Calculate_Reaction_Rate (15.0, 600); -- Out of range
```

This prevents a critical error where a pressure value might be mistakenly
passed to a function expecting a temperature—a scenario that could cause
dangerous overheating in a real chemical plant.

**Advanced Example**: In a pharmaceutical manufacturing system:

```ada
package Drug_Manufacturing is
   type Drug_Concentration is digits 6 range 0.0 .. 100.0;
   type Reaction_Temperature is range 0 .. 150;
   type Reaction_Pressure is digits 4 range 0.0 .. 10.0;

   procedure Start_Reaction
     (Concentration : Drug_Concentration;
      Temperature : Reaction_Temperature;
      Pressure : Reaction_Pressure)
     with Pre => Temperature >= 20 and Pressure <= 5.0;
end Drug_Manufacturing;
```

This ensures that the reaction parameters are always within safe ranges,
preventing dangerous conditions that could compromise drug quality or safety.

### 2.5.2 A Case Study: A Fly-by-Wire Flight Control System

Modern aircraft rely on complex control systems where precision is paramount:

```ada
type Altitude_Ft is new Float range 0.0 .. 50_000.0;
type Airspeed_Kts is new Float range 0.0 .. 1_000.0;
type Engine_Thrust is new Float range 0.0 .. 100.0; -- Percentage

-- Define control system components
type Flight_Control is record
   Altitude : Altitude_Ft;
   Airspeed : Airspeed_Kts;
   Thrust : Engine_Thrust;
end record;

procedure Adjust_Thrust (Control : in out Flight_Control; New_Thrust : Engine_Thrust) is
begin
   Control.Thrust := New_Thrust;
end Adjust_Thrust;
```

**Error Prevention**:

```ada
-- Valid call
Adjust_Thrust (Control, 75.0);

-- Invalid calls (all fail at compile time):
Adjust_Thrust (Control, -10.0); -- Out of range
Adjust_Thrust (Control, 150.0); -- Out of range
Adjust_Thrust (Control, 1500.0); -- Wrong type (airspeed instead of thrust)
```

This prevents a critical error where a pilot's altitude input might be
mistakenly used for thrust control—a scenario that could cause catastrophic
loss of control.

**Advanced Example**: In a commercial airliner's flight control system:

```ada
package Flight_Control is
   type Altitude is new Float range 0.0 .. 50_000.0;
   type Airspeed is new Float range 0.0 .. 1_000.0;
   type Engine_Thrust is new Float range 0.0 .. 100.0;
   type Pitch_Angle is new Float range -90.0 .. 90.0;

   procedure Adjust_Altitude (Control : in out Flight_Control; New_Altitude : Altitude)
     with Pre => New_Altitude <= Control.Current_Altitude + 1000.0;

   procedure Adjust_Airspeed (Control : in out Flight_Control; New_Airspeed : Airspeed)
     with Pre => New_Airspeed <= Control.Max_Airspeed;

   procedure Adjust_Pitch (Control : in out Flight_Control; New_Pitch : Pitch_Angle)
     with Pre => New_Pitch >= -30.0 and New_Pitch <= 30.0;
end Flight_Control;
```

This ensures that flight control inputs are always within safe limits,
preventing dangerous maneuvers that could cause structural damage or loss of
control.

### 2.5.3 A Case Study: Financial Transaction System

Financial systems require precise decimal arithmetic to avoid rounding errors:

```ada
-- Fixed-point currency type
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
type Transaction_Count is range 1..1_000_000_000;

-- Define transaction processing
procedure Process_Transaction
   (Amount : Currency;
    Count : Transaction_Count)
is
begin
   -- Process transaction
end Process_Transaction;
```

**Type Safety**:

```ada
-- Valid call
Process_Transaction (100.50, 1);

-- Invalid calls (all fail at compile time):
Process_Transaction (100.5, 1); -- Wrong type (Float instead of Currency)
Process_Transaction (100.50, 1.0); -- Wrong type (Float instead of Transaction_Count)
Process_Transaction (100.50, 0); -- Out of range for count
```

This prevents a critical error where a transaction amount might be mistakenly
used as a count, or where floating-point imprecision causes financial
discrepancies. In banking systems, even small rounding errors can accumulate
to millions of dollars over time.

**Advanced Example**: In a stock trading system:

```ada
package Stock_Trading is
   type Price is delta 0.01 digits 15 range 0.0 .. 1_000_000.00;
   type Quantity is range 1..1_000_000;
   type Trade_Amount is delta 0.01 digits 15;

   procedure Execute_Trade
     (Price : Price;
      Quantity : Quantity;
      Trade_Amount : out Trade_Amount)
     with Pre => Quantity >= 1 and Quantity <= 1_000_000,
          Post => Trade_Amount = Price * Quantity;
end Stock_Trading;
```

This ensures that trades are always calculated correctly, preventing financial
errors that could cost millions of dollars.

### 2.5.4 A Case Study: Medical Device Safety System

Consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs and alerts
healthcare providers to potential issues:

```ada
package Patient_Monitoring is
   type Heart_Rate is range 20..250;
   type Blood_Pressure is range 40..250;
   type Oxygen_Saturation is range 0..100;
   type Temperature_Celsius is range 30..45;

   type Vital_Signs is record
      Heart_Rate : Heart_Rate;
      Blood_Pressure : Blood_Pressure;
      Oxygen_Saturation : Oxygen_Saturation;
      Temperature : Temperature_Celsius;
   end record;

   procedure Check_Vitals (Vitals : Vital_Signs; Alert : out Alert_Type)
     with Pre => Vitals.Heart_Rate in 20..250,
          Pre => Vitals.Blood_Pressure in 40..250,
          Pre => Vitals.Oxygen_Saturation in 0..100,
          Pre => Vitals.Temperature in 30..45,
          Post => (if Alert = Critical then
                   Vitals.Heart_Rate < 40 or Vitals.Heart_Rate > 200 or
                   Vitals.Blood_Pressure < 70 or Vitals.Blood_Pressure > 200 or
                   Vitals.Oxygen_Saturation < 90 or
                   Vitals.Temperature < 35 or Vitals.Temperature > 42);
end Patient_Monitoring;
```

This ensures that vital signs are always within physiological ranges, and that
alerts are only generated when truly critical conditions are detected. The
compiler verifies these contracts at compile time, preventing runtime errors
that could compromise patient safety.

**Real-World Impact**: In a real-world medical device, these type constraints
could prevent a critical error where a temperature reading of 50°C (which is
physically impossible for a human) is mistakenly processed as valid, leading
to incorrect medical decisions.

### 2.5.5 A Case Study: Industrial Automation System

Consider an industrial automation system that controls manufacturing
equipment:

```ada
package Industrial_Automation is
   type Motor_Speed is range 0..10000;
   type Pressure_Psi is range 0..5000;
   type Temperature_Fahrenheit is range 32..300;
   type Valve_Position is range 0..100;

   type Equipment_Status is record
      Motor_Speed : Motor_Speed;
      Pressure : Pressure_Psi;
      Temperature : Temperature_Fahrenheit;
      Valve_Position : Valve_Position;
   end record;

   procedure Control_Equipment (Status : in out Equipment_Status)
     with Pre => Status.Motor_Speed <= 9000,
          Pre => Status.Pressure <= 4500,
          Pre => Status.Temperature <= 250,
          Pre => Status.Valve_Position <= 80,
          Post => (if Status.Valve_Position > 70 then
                   Status.Pressure <= 3000 and Status.Temperature <= 200);
end Industrial_Automation;
```

This ensures that equipment operations stay within safe limits, preventing
damage to machinery or hazardous conditions. The compiler verifies these
constraints at compile time, ensuring that any violation is caught before
deployment.

**Real-World Impact**: In a chemical plant, these constraints could prevent a
critical error where a valve is opened beyond safe limits, causing a dangerous
pressure buildup that could lead to an explosion.

## 2.6 Summary and Conclusion

### 2.6.1 Review of Key Concepts

- Ada's type system is designed to **prevent errors before they occur**, not
  just detect them at runtime
- **Subtypes** provide constrained views of existing types without changing
  compatibility
- **Derived types** create distinct types for physical units and other
  distinct concepts
- **Private types** enable information hiding and controlled access to data
- Ada's compiler enforces type constraints at compile time, eliminating entire
  classes of runtime errors
- Contract-based programming allows the compiler to verify correctness
  properties at compile time

### 2.6.2 The Long-Term Benefits of Ada's Type System

The upfront investment in Ada's type system delivers significant long-term
benefits:

- **Reduced debugging time**: 80% of bugs are caught at compile time[^compile-stat]
- **Improved maintainability**: Code is self-documenting through meaningful
  types
- **Enhanced safety**: Prevents unit mix-ups, range errors, and invalid states
- **Lower long-term costs**: Systems built with Ada require significantly less
   maintenance than equivalent systems in other languages

[^compile-stat]: Self-reported project averages; see the caveats later in this section for context before citing.

Public case studies from organizations such as the European Space Agency and
Boeing have reported notable reductions in concurrency bugs and maintenance
costs when comparing Ada projects with C or C++ baselines. The specific
percentages vary by program and measurement approach, but the recurring theme
is that Ada's upfront rigor pays dividends over long-lived projects.

**Industry Anecdotes** (self-reported figures from conference presentations
and internal studies):

- NASA's Mars Rovers teams have described order-of-magnitude defect reductions
   relative to comparable C implementations
- Airbus A380 engineering retrospectives cite dramatic drops in critical
   defects when using Ada compared to C
- U.S. Department of Defense briefings point to substantial decreases in
   software-related mission failures on Ada programs
- Medical device manufacturers report notable reductions in critical safety
   issues after migrating high-risk components to Ada

These data points are best read as qualitative trends; consult the original
presentations and reports for methodology and context before relying on the
numbers in isolation.

### 2.6.3 Transitioning to a Type-Safe Mindset

Adopting Ada's type system requires a mindset shift:

1. **Think in terms of meaning, not just storage**: Every variable should
   represent a specific physical concept
2. **Define types precisely**: Don't just use `Float`—use `Altitude_Feet`,
   `Meters`, or `Temperature_Celsius`
3. **Leverage the compiler**: Let the compiler enforce constraints rather than
   relying on runtime checks
4. **Embrace self-documenting code**: Types should communicate intent without
   requiring external documentation
5. **Use contracts proactively**: Define preconditions, postconditions, and
   type invariants to verify correctness

As one senior engineer at Airbus noted: _"In Ada, the type system is not a
limitation—it is a superpower. It transforms what would be a debugging
nightmare in other languages into a compile-time certainty."_

By mastering Ada's type system, you'll write code that is not only correct but
provably safe—ensuring your software is reliable from the very first line. In
the next chapter, we'll explore how Ada's modular architecture through
packages enables large-scale system design while maintaining type safety
across components.

### 2.6.4 The Future of Type Safety in Ada

Ada continues to evolve its type system with each new standard:

- **Ada 2022**: Added enhanced contract support for anonymous types, refined
  array handling, and improved parallelism with type-safe concurrency
- **Future Directions**: Potential additions include:
  - More sophisticated contract-based verification
  - Enhanced support for formal methods
  - Improved integration with machine learning systems
  - Advanced type inference for more concise code

As systems become more complex—autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, medical
robotics—Ada's type system will remain the gold standard for building
reliable, safe software. By mastering Ada's type system today, you're
investing in skills that will be increasingly valuable in tomorrow's
technology landscape.

"Ada's type system is not just about preventing errors—it's about building
trust in software. When you know your code is type-safe, you can focus on
solving real problems rather than chasing bugs."  
— Senior Software Engineer, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory
