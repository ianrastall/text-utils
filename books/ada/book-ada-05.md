# Chapter 5: Scalar Types

> "In Ada, scalar types are the foundation of safe and reliable systems. They are not just containers for data—they are precise specifications of what the data means and how it should be used. This precision is critical in safety-critical systems where a single type mismatch can lead to catastrophic failures."

## 5.1 Declarations and Objects

### 5.1.1 Variables, Constants, and Assignments

Ada's declaration model is designed for clarity and safety. Unlike many languages where variables can be implicitly declared, Ada requires all variables and constants to be explicitly declared before use. This strict requirement prevents "magic variable" errors common in dynamic languages and ensures every object has a clearly defined purpose.

#### Variable Declaration Syntax

Variables are declared using the following syntax:

```ada
variable_name : type_name := initial_value;
```

For example:

```ada
Current_Temperature : Float := 25.5;
Total_Count : Integer := 0;
```

The colon (`:`) separates the identifier from its type, and the assignment operator (`:=`) provides an initial value. The initial value is optional, but if omitted, the variable is uninitialized until explicitly assigned.

Ada's strict initialization rules are a key safety feature. Uninitialized variables are a common source of bugs in other languages, but Ada eliminates this entire class of errors at compile time. When you see a variable declaration, you know exactly what its initial value is.

#### Constant Declaration Syntax

Constants are declared similarly but with the `constant` keyword:

```ada
constant constant_name : type_name := value;
```

For example:

```ada
Max_Temperature : constant Float := 100.0;
Pi : constant Float := 3.14159;
```

Constants must be initialized at declaration and cannot be modified afterward. This ensures that critical values remain unchanged throughout program execution.

Constants are particularly valuable for safety-critical systems where certain values must never change. For example, in an aircraft navigation system, the maximum altitude for commercial aircraft might be defined as a constant:

```ada
Max_Altitude : constant Float := 50_000.0;
```

This ensures that no part of the system can accidentally modify this critical safety parameter.

#### Assignment Operator

Ada uses `:=` for assignment, distinguishing it from the equality operator (`=`). This prevents common errors where `=` is mistakenly used for assignment:

```ada
-- Incorrect (C-style)
if x = 10 then
   x = 20;  -- This is a syntax error in Ada
end if;

-- Correct
if x = 10 then
   x := 20;
end if;
```

This distinction is critical in safety-critical systems where subtle syntax errors could lead to dangerous behavior. In C, this mistake would compile but cause unexpected behavior; in Ada, the compiler immediately flags the issue with a clear diagnostic.

#### Type Safety in Assignments

Ada enforces strict type safety in assignments. You cannot assign a value of one type to a variable of another type without explicit conversion:

```ada
-- Incorrect
X : Integer := 10.5;  -- Compile error: no implicit conversion

-- Correct
X : Integer := Integer(10.5);  -- Explicit conversion
```

This prevents subtle bugs that occur when values are implicitly converted between incompatible types. For example, in a financial system, assigning a floating-point value to an integer count could lead to data loss:

```ada
-- Incorrect
Transaction_Count : Integer := 100.5;  -- Would lose the fractional part

-- Correct
Transaction_Count : Integer := Integer(100.5);
```

#### Real-World Example: Aerospace System

In an aircraft navigation system:

```ada
Current_Latitude : Float := 40.7128;
Current_Longitude : Float := -74.0060;
Max_Altitude : constant Float := 50_000.0;

-- Correct assignment
Current_Altitude : Float := 35_000.0;

-- Incorrect assignment (would fail to compile)
Current_Altitude := "35000";  -- Type mismatch
```

The explicit type declarations ensure that altitude values are always numeric, preventing errors where string values might be accidentally assigned.

#### Note Box: The Importance of Explicit Initialization

> "In Ada, every variable must be explicitly initialized or assigned before use. This is not just a syntax rule—it's a safety feature. Uninitialized variables are a common source of bugs in other languages, but Ada eliminates this entire class of errors at compile time. When you see a variable declaration, you know exactly what its initial value is."

#### Table 5.1: Variable and Constant Declaration Examples

| Declaration Type | Syntax | Example | Safety Benefit |
|------------------|--------|---------|---------------|
| Variable | `var_name : type := value;` | `Temperature : Float := 25.5;` | Ensures initial value is defined |
| Constant | `constant const_name : type := value;` | `Max_Temp : constant Float := 100.0;` | Prevents accidental modification |
| Uninitialized Variable | `var_name : type;` | `Current_Count : Integer;` | Requires explicit initialization before use |
| Constant Without Initial Value | `constant const_name : type;` | `Error: constant must be initialized` | Prevents undefined constant values |

#### Detailed Initialization Scenarios

Ada's initialization rules cover a wide range of scenarios:

**Default Initialization**

For some types, Ada provides default initialization:

```ada
-- For numeric types, default is 0
X : Integer;  -- Automatically initialized to 0

-- For boolean types, default is False
Y : Boolean;  -- Automatically initialized to False

-- For access types, default is null
Z : Integer_Access;  -- Automatically initialized to null
```

This ensures that variables are never in an undefined state, which is critical for safety-critical systems.

**Aggregate Initialization**

For composite types like records, Ada allows aggregate initialization:

```ada
type Point is record
   X : Float;
   Y : Float;
end record;

P : Point := (X => 1.0, Y => 2.0);
```

This ensures that all fields are properly initialized, preventing partially initialized records.

**Constant Initialization**

Constants must be initialized at declaration:

```ada
-- Correct
Pi : constant Float := 3.14159;

-- Incorrect
Pi : constant Float;
Pi := 3.14159;  -- Error: constant must be initialized at declaration
```

This ensures that critical values are defined and cannot be changed later.

### 5.1.2 Blocks, Scope, and Visibility

Ada's block structure provides precise control over variable visibility and lifetime. A block is a scope that begins with `declare` and ends with `end`, containing declarations and statements.

#### Basic Block Structure

```ada
declare
   -- Local declarations
   X : Integer := 10;
   Y : Float;
begin
   -- Local statements
   Y := Float(X) * 2.0;
   Put_Line(Float'Image(Y));
end;
```

Blocks create a new scope where variables declared inside are only visible within that block. This is critical for safety-critical systems where limiting variable visibility to the smallest possible scope prevents accidental misuse of data.

#### Nested Blocks

Blocks can be nested to create multiple scopes:

```ada
declare
   A : Integer := 10;
begin
   declare
      A : Integer := 20;  -- Hides outer A
   begin
      Put_Line(Integer'Image(A));  -- Prints 20
   end;
   
   Put_Line(Integer'Image(A));  -- Prints 10
end;
```

This structure allows for precise control over variable visibility. In safety-critical systems, this is particularly valuable for isolating sensitive operations.

#### Scope Resolution

When multiple variables share the same name, the innermost declaration takes precedence. To access an outer variable, use the scope name:

```ada
declare
   A : Integer := 10;
begin
   declare
      A : Integer := 20;
   begin
      Put_Line(Integer'Image(A));  -- 20
      Put_Line(Integer'Image(outer.A));  -- 10
   end;
end;
```

This feature is particularly valuable in large systems where multiple components might use similar variable names. By explicitly specifying the scope, you prevent accidental name collisions.

#### Lifetime of Variables

Variables declared in a block exist only during the block's execution. Once the block ends, the variables are destroyed:

```ada
declare
   Temp : Float := 25.5;
begin
   -- Temp is accessible here
end;
-- Temp is no longer accessible here
```

This ensures that resources are properly managed and that variables don't persist longer than needed. In safety-critical systems, this is critical for preventing memory leaks and ensuring predictable behavior.

#### Real-World Example: Medical Device System

In a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
declare
   Heart_Rate : Integer := 72;
   Blood_Pressure : Integer := 120;
begin
   -- Process vital signs
   if Heart_Rate > 100 then
      declare
         Emergency_Code : String := "CRITICAL";
      begin
         Trigger_Alert(Emergency_Code);
      end;
   end if;
   
   -- Emergency_Code is not accessible here
end;
```

This structure ensures that emergency-related variables are only visible where needed, preventing accidental misuse of sensitive data.

#### Note Box: The Power of Block Scoping

> "Ada's block scoping is not just about organizing code—it's about safety. In safety-critical systems, limiting variable visibility to the smallest possible scope prevents accidental misuse of data. When you see a variable declaration inside a block, you know exactly where it can be used and for how long. This precision is critical when lives depend on your software."
> 
> — Principal Engineer, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory

#### Table 5.2: Block Scope Examples

| Scenario | Code | Scope |
|----------|------|-------|
| Outer Variable | `declare X : Integer := 10; begin ... end;` | Visible throughout block |
| Inner Variable | `declare X : Integer := 10; declare Y : Integer := 20; begin ... end; end;` | X visible throughout outer block; Y visible only in inner block |
| Shadowed Variable | `declare X : Integer := 10; begin declare X : Integer := 20; begin ... end; end;` | Outer X visible in outer block; inner X hides outer X in inner block |
| Accessing Outer Variable | `declare X : Integer := 10; begin declare X : Integer := 20; begin Put_Line(outer.X); end; end;` | Outer.X accesses the outer variable |

#### Advanced Block Features

Ada blocks can contain exception handlers:

```ada
declare
   File : File_Type;
begin
   Open(File, In_File, "data.txt");
   -- Process file
   Close(File);
exception
   when Name_Error =>
      Put_Line("File not found");
   when others =>
      Put_Line("Unexpected error occurred");
end;
```

This structure ensures that errors are handled locally, preventing exceptions from propagating to higher levels of the system.

Blocks can also contain nested subprograms:

```ada
declare
   X : Integer := 10;
   
   procedure Calculate is
      Y : Integer := 20;
   begin
      Put_Line(Integer'Image(X + Y));
   end Calculate;
begin
   Calculate;
end;
```

This allows for precise encapsulation of functionality within a specific context.

#### Real-World Example: Aerospace System

In an aircraft control system:

```ada
declare
   Altitude : Float := 35_000.0;
   Airspeed : Float := 500.0;
   
   procedure Calculate_Distance is
      Distance : Float;
   begin
      -- Calculate distance using current altitude and airspeed
      Distance := Calculate_Distance(Altitude, Airspeed);
      Put_Line("Distance: " & Float'Image(Distance));
   end Calculate_Distance;
begin
   Calculate_Distance;
end;
```

This structure ensures that the distance calculation uses only the relevant variables and that the calculation is properly encapsulated.

## 5.2 The Type Model

### 5.2.1 Types, Subtypes, and Constraints

Ada's type system is built around the concept of precise constraints. Every type can have constraints that define its valid range of values, ensuring that only meaningful data is stored.

#### Type Declaration

A type declaration creates a new, distinct type:

```ada
type Temperature is range -50..150;
```

This creates a new type where variables can only hold values between -50 and 150.

#### Subtype Declaration

A subtype is a constrained view of an existing type:

```ada
subtype Normal_Temperature is Temperature range -40..85;
```

Subtypes inherit all operations from their base type but restrict values to a specific range.

#### Constraints

Constraints define the valid values for a type or subtype:

```ada
type Sensor_Value is range 0..100;
subtype Valid_Sensor_Value is Sensor_Value range 0..90;
```

Constraints can also be applied to floating-point types:

```ada
type Voltage is digits 6 range 0.0..12.0;
```

#### Runtime and Compile-Time Checks

Ada enforces constraints both at compile time and runtime:

```ada
-- Compile-time error
Value : Sensor_Value := 101;

-- Runtime error
Input : Integer := 101;
Value : Sensor_Value := Sensor_Value(Input);
```

#### Real-World Example: Financial System

In a financial transaction system:

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
subtype Valid_Amount is Currency range 0.01..1_000_000.00;

-- Compile-time error
Transaction_Amount : Valid_Amount := -100.0;

-- Runtime error
Input : Float := -100.0;
Transaction_Amount := Valid_Amount(Input);
```

This ensures that financial amounts are always positive and within reasonable limits, preventing errors that could cause financial loss.

#### Note Box: Why Constraints Matter

> "In Ada, constraints are not optional—they are the safety net that prevents invalid data from entering your system. When you define a type with precise constraints, you're not just specifying storage—you're defining the physical reality of what that data represents. In a medical device, for example, a heart rate type with constraints of 20-250 ensures that no sensor reading outside physiological limits can be processed, preventing false alarms or missed emergencies."

#### Table 5.3: Type vs. Subtype vs. Derived Type

| Feature | Type | Subtype | Derived Type |
|---------|------|---------|--------------|
| New Type Identity | Yes | No | Yes |
| Assignment Compatibility | No | Yes | No |
| Constraints | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Inherited Operations | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Explicit Conversion Required | Yes | No | Yes |
| Example | `type Temperature is range -50..150;` | `subtype Normal_Temp is Temperature range -40..85;` | `type Meters is new Float;` |

#### Detailed Constraint Examples

Ada allows for sophisticated constraints that go beyond simple range limits:

**Precision Constraints**

```ada
type High_Precision_Float is digits 15;
type Low_Precision_Float is digits 6;
```

Here, `digits 15` specifies at least 15 significant decimal digits of precision, while `digits 6` specifies at least 6 significant decimal digits.

**Delta Constraints**

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
```

This specifies that the smallest increment is 0.01 (for currency values), with at least 15 significant digits.

**Dynamic Predicates**

```ada
type Valid_Heart_Rate is Heart_Rate
  with Dynamic_Predicate => Valid_Heart_Rate in 30..250;
```

This ensures that any variable of type `Valid_Heart_Rate` stays within physiological ranges.

#### Real-World Example: Scientific Calculation

In a physics simulation:

```ada
type Acceleration is digits 10 range -100.0..100.0;
gravity : constant Acceleration := 9.80665;
speed : Acceleration := 0.0;
time : Float := 10.0;

speed := gravity * time;  -- 98.0665
```

This ensures precise calculation of acceleration values while maintaining the physical constraints of the system.

### 5.2.2 Derived Types

Derived types create new types based on existing types while maintaining distinct identity. Unlike subtypes, derived types are not assignment-compatible with their parent type.

#### Derived Type Declaration

```ada
type Meters is new Float;
type Kilometers is new Float;
```

These are distinct types—`Meters` and `Kilometers` cannot be assigned to each other without explicit conversion.

#### Inheritance of Operations

Derived types inherit all operations from their parent type:

```ada
M1 : Meters := 10.0;
M2 : Meters := 20.0;
Sum : Meters := M1 + M2;  -- Valid
```

#### Explicit Conversion

To convert between derived types, you must use explicit conversion:

```ada
K1 : Kilometers := Kilometers(M1);
```

#### Real-World Example: Aerospace System

In an aircraft navigation system:

```ada
type Latitude is new Float range -90.0..90.0;
type Longitude is new Float range -180.0..180.0;

-- This fails to compile:
Latitude := Longitude(45.0);  -- Incompatible types

-- Must explicitly convert:
Latitude := Convert_Longitude_to_Latitude(Longitude(45.0));
```

This prevents accidental mixing of latitude and longitude values—a critical safety feature in navigation systems.

#### Advanced Derived Type Features

Derived types can override operations:

```ada
type Special_Float is new Float with record
   Precision : Natural;
end record;

function "+" (Left, Right : Special_Float) return Special_Float is
begin
   return (Precision => Left.Precision, 
           Float'Image (Float (Left) + Float (Right)));
end "+";
```

This creates a new type that extends the functionality of `Float` while maintaining type safety.

#### Real-World Example: Financial System

In a financial transaction system:

```ada
type USD is new Float;
type EUR is new Float;

-- This fails to compile:
USD := EUR(100.0);  -- Incompatible types

-- Must explicitly convert:
USD := Convert_EUR_to_USD(EUR(100.0));
```

This ensures that currency conversions are explicit and intentional, preventing subtle errors that could cause financial loss.

#### Note Box: The Power of Derived Types

> "Derived types in Ada are not just about preventing unit mix-ups—they're about creating a type system that reflects the physical reality of your system. When you define a type for meters and a type for feet, the compiler ensures you never accidentally add them together without proper conversion. This precision is what makes Ada the language of choice for safety-critical systems."

## 5.3 Integer Types

### 5.3.1 Signed and Modular Integers

Ada provides two main categories of integer types: signed integers and modular integers.

#### Signed Integers

Signed integers represent positive and negative whole numbers:

```ada
type Temperature is range -50..150;
type Altitude is range 0..50000;
```

Signed integers have a defined range with minimum and maximum values.

#### Modular Integers

Modular integers represent unsigned values that wrap around when exceeding their range:

```ada
type Bit is mod 2;  -- 0 or 1
type Byte is mod 256;  -- 0 to 255
```

Modular integers are useful for bit manipulation and low-level operations where wrap-around behavior is desired.

#### Arithmetic Operations

For signed integers, arithmetic operations that exceed the range raise a `Constraint_Error`:

```ada
Value : Temperature := 140;
Value := Value + 20;  -- Raises Constraint_Error
```

For modular integers, operations wrap around within the defined range:

```ada
Value : Byte := 255;
Value := Value + 1;  -- Value becomes 0
```

#### Real-World Example: Embedded System

In an embedded system controlling a motor:

```ada
type Motor_Speed is range 0..10000;
type Motor_Steps is mod 360;  -- 0-359 degrees

-- Signed integer (raises error)
Current_Speed : Motor_Speed := 9500;
Current_Speed := Current_Speed + 1000;  -- Constraint_Error

-- Modular integer (wraps around)
Current_Step : Motor_Steps := 355;
Current_Step := Current_Step + 10;  -- Becomes 5
```

This structure ensures that motor speed stays within physical limits while allowing step counts to wrap around naturally.

#### Note Box: When to Use Modular Integers

> "Modular integers are not just for bit manipulation—they're a powerful tool for modeling cyclic phenomena. In navigation systems, for example, angles naturally wrap around at 360 degrees. Using a modular type for angles ensures that calculations like `angle + 180` always produce valid results without special handling for the wrap-around point. This precision prevents subtle bugs that would otherwise require complex conditional logic."
> 
> — Senior Software Engineer, Aerospace Industry

#### Table 5.4: Signed vs. Modular Integer Behavior

| Operation | Signed Integer | Modular Integer |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Addition within range | Works normally | Works normally |
| Addition beyond range | Raises Constraint_Error | Wraps around within range |
| Subtraction within range | Works normally | Works normally |
| Subtraction below range | Raises Constraint_Error | Wraps around within range |
| Example | `Temperature := 150 + 10;` → Error | `Byte := 255 + 1;` → 0 |

#### Detailed Integer Operations

Ada provides several integer operations that work differently for signed and modular integers:

**Modulo Operation**

For modular integers, the modulo operation is built-in:

```ada
type Byte is mod 256;
X : Byte := 255;
Y : Byte := 1;
Z : Byte := X + Y;  -- Z = 0 (wraps around)
```

**Mod and Rem Operators**

For signed integers, Ada provides `mod` and `rem` operators:

```ada
X : Integer := -10;
Y : Integer := 3;
Z1 : Integer := X mod Y;  -- Z1 = 2
Z2 : Integer := X rem Y;  -- Z2 = -1
```

These operators behave differently for negative numbers, which is critical for mathematical calculations.

#### Real-World Example: Medical Device System

In a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
type Heart_Rate is range 20..250;
type Pulse_Count is mod 100;  -- 0-99 pulses

-- Heart rate (signed)
Current_Heart_Rate : Heart_Rate := 72;
Current_Heart_Rate := Current_Heart_Rate + 1;  -- 73

-- Pulse count (modular)
Current_Pulse : Pulse_Count := 99;
Current_Pulse := Current_Pulse + 1;  -- Becomes 0
```

This structure ensures that heart rates stay within physiological limits while allowing pulse counts to wrap around naturally.

### 5.3.2 Predefined Integer Types: Integer, Natural, Positive

Ada provides several predefined integer types for common use cases.

#### Standard Integer Types

```ada
type Integer is range -2**31..2**31-1;  -- Typically 32-bit
type Long_Integer is range -2**63..2**63-1;  -- Typically 64-bit
```

These types have implementation-defined ranges but must support at least the specified minimums.

#### Specialized Integer Types

Ada also provides specialized integer types for common use cases:

```ada
type Natural is range 0..Integer'Last;  -- Non-negative integers
type Positive is range 1..Integer'Last;  -- Positive integers
```

These types are particularly useful for array indices and counts where negative values are meaningless.

#### Real-World Example: Medical Device System

In a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
-- Standard integer for sensor readings
type Sensor_Value is range -32768..32767;

-- Specialized types for counts
type Heart_Rate is Positive;  -- Must be at least 1
type Patient_Count is Natural;  -- Can be zero or positive

-- Valid
Current_Heart_Rate : Heart_Rate := 72;
Patient_Count := 10;

-- Invalid (would fail to compile)
Current_Heart_Rate := 0;  -- Heart_Rate must be positive
Patient_Count := -1;  -- Natural cannot be negative
```

This structure ensures that heart rates are always positive (physiologically meaningful) while patient counts can be zero (no patients present).

#### Note Box: Why Predefined Integer Types Matter

> "Predefined integer types in Ada are not just convenient—they're safety-critical. When you use `Positive` for a heart rate, you're not just saying 'this is a number'—you're saying 'this must be a positive number,' which is a physiological reality. This precision prevents errors that would otherwise require manual validation and error checking."
> 
> — Principal Engineer, Medical Device Manufacturer

#### Table 5.5: Predefined Integer Types

| Type | Range | Typical Use Case |
|------|-------|------------------|
| Integer | -2^31 to 2^31-1 | General-purpose integers |
| Long_Integer | -2^63 to 2^63-1 | Large numbers (e.g., timestamps) |
| Natural | 0 to Integer'Last | Counts, array indices |
| Positive | 1 to Integer'Last | Positive counts, array indices (1-based) |
| Byte | 0 to 255 | 8-bit values |
| Word | 0 to 65535 | 16-bit values |

#### Detailed Integer Type Examples

Ada provides several additional predefined integer types for specific use cases:

**Boolean Type**

```ada
type Boolean is (False, True);
```

While not technically an integer type, Boolean is often used with integer operations in Ada.

**Character Type**

```ada
type Character is (' ', '!', '"', '#', ...);
```

Character is an enumeration type that can be used with integer operations.

**Standard Integer Ranges**

```ada
type Short_Integer is range -2**15..2**15-1;  -- 16-bit
type Long_Long_Integer is range -2**63..2**63-1;  -- 64-bit
```

These types provide more precise control over integer size.

#### Real-World Example: Aerospace System

In an aircraft navigation system:

```ada
type Latitude is new Float range -90.0..90.0;
type Longitude is new Float range -180.0..180.0;

-- Standard integer for array indices
type Array_Index is Positive range 1..100;
type Sensor_Data is array (Array_Index) of Float;

-- Valid
Data : Sensor_Data;
Data(1) := 25.5;  -- Valid index

-- Invalid (would fail to compile)
Data(0) := 25.5;  -- Index must be positive
Data(101) := 25.5;  -- Index must be <= 100
```

This structure ensures that array indices are always valid, preventing buffer overflows and other common errors.

## 5.4 Enumeration Types

### 5.4.1 Declaring Enumerations

Enumeration types define a closed set of named values. They are ideal for representing discrete states or options.

#### Basic Enumeration Declaration

```ada
type Color is (Red, Green, Blue);
type System_State is (Idle, Running, Paused, Error);
type Communication_Protocol is (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP);
```

Each value in the enumeration is distinct and has no inherent numeric value.

#### Enumeration Literals

Enumeration literals must be used in their declared form:

```ada
My_Color : Color := Red;
My_Color := "Yellow";  -- Compile error: invalid value
```

#### Enumeration Types with Attributes

Enumerations can have attributes that provide additional information:

```ada
type Traffic_Light is (Red, Yellow, Green) with
   Size => 2;  -- Specify storage size in bits
```

This specifies that the type should use exactly 2 bits of storage, which is valuable for embedded systems with memory constraints.

#### Real-World Example: Aerospace System

In an aircraft control system:

```ada
type Flight_Mode is (Takeoff, Cruise, Landing, Emergency);
Current_Mode : Flight_Mode := Cruise;

-- Valid
Current_Mode := Landing;

-- Invalid (would fail to compile)
Current_Mode := "Unknown";  -- Compile error: unknown value
```

This ensures that flight modes always stay within the defined set, preventing invalid states that could cause system failures.

#### Note Box: The Power of Enumeration Types

> "Enumeration types are not just convenient—they're safety-critical. In a system where a single invalid state could cause a plane to crash or a patient to die, having a closed set of valid states is non-negotiable. When you see a variable of type `Flight_Mode`, you know exactly which values it can hold without needing to consult documentation. This precision is what makes Ada the language of choice for safety-critical systems."
> 
> — Principal Engineer, Airbus Defense and Space

#### Table 5.6: Enumeration Type Examples

| Enumeration Type | Values | Use Case |
|------------------|--------|----------|
| Color | (Red, Green, Blue) | Visual indicators |
| System_State | (Idle, Running, Paused, Error) | System status |
| Communication_Protocol | (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP) | Network protocols |
| Flight_Mode | (Takeoff, Cruise, Landing, Emergency) | Aircraft control |
| Traffic_Light | (Red, Yellow, Green) | Traffic control |

#### Advanced Enumeration Features

Ada provides several advanced features for enumeration types:

**Enumeration Representation**

```ada
type State is (Off, On) with
   Size => 1,  -- Use 1 bit of storage
   Representation => (Off => 0, On => 1);
```

This specifies the exact bit representation for each value.

**Enumeration Attributes**

```ada
type Color is (Red, Green, Blue);
Red_Pos : Natural := Color'Pos(Red);  -- 0
Green_Pos : Natural := Color'Pos(Green);  -- 1
Blue_Pos : Natural := Color'Pos(Blue);  -- 2
```

These attributes provide additional information about the enumeration values.

#### Real-World Example: Medical Device System

In a medical device that monitors vital signs:

```ada
type Alert_Level is (Normal, Warning, Critical);
Current_Alert : Alert_Level := Normal;

-- Get next alert level
Next_Alert : Alert_Level := Alert_Level'Succ(Current_Alert);

-- Get position of current alert
Alert_Pos : Natural := Alert_Level'Pos(Current_Alert);

-- Convert position to alert level
Alert_Level_Value : Alert_Level := Alert_Level'Val(Alert_Pos);
```

This structure allows for safe transitions between alert levels while ensuring that only valid transitions are possible.

### 5.4.2 Operations and Attributes ('Succ, 'Pred, 'Pos, 'Val)

Ada provides several attributes for working with enumeration types.

#### Successor and Predecessor Attributes

The `'Succ` and `'Pred` attributes return the next or previous value in the enumeration:

```ada
Next_Color : Color := Color'Succ(Red);  -- Green
Prev_Color : Color := Color'Pred(Green);  -- Red
```

These attributes work with any enumeration type, regardless of the underlying representation.

#### Position Attribute

The `'Pos` attribute returns the position number of an enumeration value (starting from 0):

```ada
Red_Pos : Natural := Color'Pos(Red);  -- 0
Green_Pos : Natural := Color'Pos(Green);  -- 1
```

#### Value Attribute

The `'Val` attribute returns the enumeration value at a given position:

```ada
Color_Value : Color := Color'Val(1);  -- Green
```

#### Real-World Example: Medical Device System

In a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
type Alert_Level is (Normal, Warning, Critical);
Current_Alert : Alert_Level := Normal;

-- Get next alert level
Next_Alert : Alert_Level := Alert_Level'Succ(Current_Alert);

-- Get position of current alert
Alert_Pos : Natural := Alert_Level'Pos(Current_Alert);

-- Convert position to alert level
Alert_Level_Value : Alert_Level := Alert_Level'Val(Alert_Pos);
```

This structure allows for safe transitions between alert levels while ensuring that only valid transitions are possible.

#### Note Box: Why Enumeration Attributes Matter

> "Enumeration attributes in Ada are not just convenient—they're safety-critical. When you use `Alert_Level'Succ(Current_Alert)`, you're not just getting the next value—you're ensuring that the transition is valid and safe. This precision prevents errors that would otherwise require manual validation and error checking."

#### Table 5.7: Enumeration Attributes

| Attribute | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `'Succ` | Returns the next value in the enumeration | `Color'Succ(Red)` |
| `'Pred` | Returns the previous value in the enumeration | `Color'Pred(Green)` |
| `'Pos` | Returns the position number (0-based) | `Color'Pos(Red)` |
| `'Val` | Returns the value at a given position | `Color'Val(1)` |
| `'Image` | Returns the string representation | `Color'Image(Red)` |
| `'Value` | Returns the value from a string | `Color'Value("Green")` |

#### Detailed Enumeration Operations

Ada provides several additional operations for enumeration types:

**Range Operations**

```ada
type Color is (Red, Green, Blue);
Color_Range : Color := Red..Blue;  -- Red to Blue
```

This creates a range of enumeration values.

**Equality and Comparison**

```ada
if Color1 = Color2 then
   -- Do something
end if;
```

Enumeration types support equality and comparison operations, which is critical for state machines.

#### Real-World Example: Aerospace System

In an aircraft control system:

```ada
type Flight_Mode is (Takeoff, Cruise, Landing, Emergency);
Current_Mode : Flight_Mode := Cruise;

-- Check if mode is valid
if Current_Mode in Flight_Mode'Range then
   -- Process mode
end if;

-- Compare modes
if Current_Mode = Cruise then
   -- Cruise mode operations
end if;
```

This structure ensures that flight modes are always valid and can be compared safely.

## 5.5 The Boolean Type

### 5.5.1 Logical Operators: and, or, xor, not

Ada's Boolean type represents true/false values and provides standard logical operators.

#### Basic Boolean Operations

```ada
A : Boolean := True;
B : Boolean := False;

And_Result : Boolean := A and B;  -- False
Or_Result : Boolean := A or B;  -- True
Xor_Result : Boolean := A xor B;  -- True
Not_Result : Boolean := not A;  -- False
```

#### Truth Table

| A | B | A and B | A or B | A xor B |
|---|---|---------|--------|---------|
| True | True | True | True | False |
| True | False | False | True | True |
| False | True | False | True | True |
| False | False | False | False | False |

#### Real-World Example: Aerospace System

In an aircraft navigation system:

```ada
Altitude_Valid : Boolean := (Current_Altitude > 0.0);
Airspeed_Valid : Boolean := (Current_Airspeed > 0.0);

-- Both altitude and airspeed must be valid
if Altitude_Valid and Airspeed_Valid then
   Calculate_Route;
end if;
```

This ensures that navigation calculations only occur when both critical inputs are valid.

#### Note Box: Why Boolean Logic Matters

> "In safety-critical systems, Boolean logic is not just about true/false values—it's about safety guarantees. When you write `if Altitude_Valid and Airspeed_Valid then`, you're not just checking conditions—you're creating a safety boundary. If either condition is false, the system will not proceed, preventing potentially dangerous operations. This precision is what makes Ada the language of choice for systems where failure is not an option."

> — Senior Software Engineer, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory

#### Table 5.8: Boolean Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `and` | Logical AND | `A and B` |
| `or` | Logical OR | `A or B` |
| `xor` | Logical XOR | `A xor B` |
| `not` | Logical NOT | `not A` |
| `and then` | Short-circuit AND | `A and then B` |
| `or else` | Short-circuit OR | `A or else B` |

#### Detailed Boolean Operations

Ada provides several additional Boolean operations:

**Conditional Expressions**

```ada
Result : Boolean := (A and B) or (C and D);
```

This creates a complex condition using multiple Boolean operations.

**Boolean Conversion**

```ada
X : Integer := 10;
B : Boolean := (X > 0);
```

This converts an integer comparison to a Boolean value.

#### Real-World Example: Medical Device System

In a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
Heart_Rate_Valid : Boolean := (Current_Heart_Rate >= 20 and Current_Heart_Rate <= 250);
Blood_Pressure_Valid : Boolean := (Current_Blood_Pressure >= 40 and Current_Blood_Pressure <= 250);

-- Both heart rate and blood pressure must be valid
if Heart_Rate_Valid and Blood_Pressure_Valid then
   Process_Vitals;
end if;
```

This structure ensures that vital signs are only processed when they're within physiological ranges.

### 5.5.2 Short-Circuit Control Forms: and then, or else

Ada provides short-circuit forms of logical operators that evaluate the second operand only when necessary.

#### and then Operator

The `and then` operator evaluates the second operand only if the first is true:

```ada
if A /= null and then A.Value > 0 then
   -- Only executes if A is not null
end if;
```

This prevents null pointer dereferences that would occur in standard `and` operations.

#### or else Operator

The `or else` operator evaluates the second operand only if the first is false:

```ada
if A = null or else A.Value > 0 then
   -- Only checks A.Value if A is not null
end if;
```

This prevents unnecessary evaluations that could cause errors.

#### Real-World Example: Medical Device System

In a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
-- Safe access to sensor data
if Sensor_Data /= null and then Sensor_Data.Heart_Rate > 100 then
   Trigger_Alert;
end if;
```

This ensures that the heart rate check only occurs if the sensor data is valid, preventing null pointer dereferences.

#### Note Box: Why Short-Circuit Operators Matter

> "Short-circuit operators in Ada are not just convenient—they're safety-critical. When you use `Sensor_Data /= null and then Sensor_Data.Heart_Rate > 100`, you're not just checking conditions—you're creating a safety boundary. If the sensor data is null, the heart rate check is never performed, preventing crashes and other dangerous behaviors. This precision is what makes Ada the language of choice for systems where failure is not an option."
> 
> — Principal Engineer, Medical Device Manufacturer

#### Table 5.9: Logical Operators Comparison

| Operator | Evaluation Behavior | Example |
|----------|---------------------|---------|
| `and` | Always evaluates both operands | `A and B` |
| `and then` | Evaluates second operand only if first is true | `A and then B` |
| `or` | Always evaluates both operands | `A or B` |
| `or else` | Evaluates second operand only if first is false | `A or else B` |

#### Detailed Short-Circuit Operations

Ada provides several additional short-circuit operations:

**Complex Conditions**

```ada
if Sensor_Data /= null and then
   Sensor_Data.Heart_Rate > 100 and then
   Sensor_Data.Blood_Pressure > 150 then
   Trigger_Emergency_Alert;
end if;
```

This creates a complex condition that safely evaluates each part.

**Exception Handling**

```ada
begin
   if Sensor_Data /= null and then
      Sensor_Data.Heart_Rate > 100 then
      Trigger_Alert;
   end if;
exception
   when others =>
      Handle_Error;
end;
```

This ensures that errors are handled safely, even in complex conditions.

#### Real-World Example: Aerospace System

In an aircraft control system:

```ada
-- Safe access to navigation data
if Navigation_Data /= null and then
   Navigation_Data.Altitude > 0.0 and then
   Navigation_Data.Airspeed > 0.0 then
   Calculate_Route;
end if;
```

This structure ensures that navigation calculations only occur when all critical inputs are valid and accessible.

## 5.6 Real Types

### 5.6.1 Floating-Point Types

Ada provides precise control over floating-point precision and range.

#### Standard Floating-Point Types

```ada
type Float is digits 6;  -- Minimum 6 decimal digits of precision
type Long_Float is digits 12;  -- Minimum 12 decimal digits of precision
```

These types have implementation-defined ranges but must support at least the specified precision.

#### Custom Floating-Point Types

You can define custom floating-point types with precise constraints:

```ada
type Voltage is digits 6 range 0.0..12.0;
type Pressure is digits 8 range 0.0..1000.0;
```

Here, `digits 6` specifies the minimum number of significant decimal digits of precision.

#### Real-World Example: Scientific Calculation

In a physics simulation:

```ada
type Acceleration is digits 10 range -100.0..100.0;
gravity : constant Acceleration := 9.80665;
speed : Acceleration := 0.0;
time : Float := 10.0;

speed := gravity * time;  -- 98.0665
```

This ensures precise calculation of acceleration values.

#### Note Box: Floating-Point Precision Matters

> "In scientific and engineering applications, floating-point precision is not a luxury—it's a necessity. A single rounding error in a financial calculation can accumulate to millions of dollars over time. In a medical device, it could mean the difference between accurate diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Ada's precise control over floating-point precision ensures that your calculations are accurate to the last digit, not just 'close enough'."
> 
> — Principal Engineer, Medical Device Manufacturer

#### Table 5.10: Floating-Point Types

| Type | Precision | Range | Typical Use Case |
|------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Float | 6 decimal digits | Implementation-defined | General-purpose floating-point |
| Long_Float | 12 decimal digits | Implementation-defined | High-precision calculations |
| Custom | User-defined | User-defined | Specialized applications |
| Voltage | digits 6 range 0.0..12.0 | 0.0 to 12.0 | Electrical measurements |
| Pressure | digits 8 range 0.0..1000.0 | 0.0 to 1000.0 | Pressure measurements |

#### Detailed Floating-Point Operations

Ada provides several additional floating-point operations:

**Rounding Modes**

```ada
pragma Round (Down);
X : Float := 1.5;
Y : Float := 1.5;
Z : Float := X + Y;  -- Rounded down
```

This controls how floating-point values are rounded.

**Precision Control**

```ada
type High_Precision_Float is digits 15;
type Low_Precision_Float is digits 6;
```

This provides precise control over floating-point precision.

#### Real-World Example: Financial System

In a financial transaction system:

```ada
type Currency is digits 15;
Amount : Currency := 100.50;
Balance : Currency := 0.0;

Balance := Balance + Amount;  -- Exact 100.50
```

This ensures that currency values are always accurate to the last digit, preventing rounding errors that could cause financial loss.

### 5.6.2 Fixed-Point Types

Fixed-point types provide exact decimal representation, which is critical for financial and embedded systems.

#### Decimal Fixed-Point Types

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
```

Here, `delta 0.01` specifies the smallest increment (0.01), and `digits 15` specifies the total number of significant digits.

#### Binary Fixed-Point Types

```ada
type Voltage is delta 0.001 range 0.0..5.0;
```

This specifies a fixed-point type with a step size of 0.001.

#### Real-World Example: Financial Transaction System

In a financial transaction system:

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
Amount : Currency := 100.50;
Balance : Currency := 0.0;

Balance := Balance + Amount;  -- Exact 100.50
```

This ensures that currency values are always accurate to two decimal places, preventing rounding errors that could cause financial loss.

#### Note Box: Why Fixed-Point Types Matter

> "Fixed-point types in Ada are not just convenient—they're safety-critical. When you use `delta 0.01` for currency, you're not just saying 'this is money'—you're saying 'this is money with exactly two decimal places,' which is a financial reality. This precision prevents errors that would otherwise require manual validation and error checking."
> 
> — Senior Software Engineer, Financial Institution

#### Table 5.11: Floating-Point vs. Fixed-Point Types

| Feature | Floating-Point | Fixed-Point |
|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Precision Control | `digits N` for significant digits | `delta X` for smallest increment |
| Range Control | `range Low..High` | `range Low..High` |
| Representation | Binary floating-point | Decimal or binary fixed-point |
| Use Cases | Scientific calculations | Financial systems, embedded control |
| Example | `type Voltage is digits 6 range 0.0..12.0;` | `type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;` |

#### Detailed Fixed-Point Operations

Ada provides several additional fixed-point operations:

**Fixed-Point Arithmetic**

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
Amount1 : Currency := 100.50;
Amount2 : Currency := 50.25;
Total : Currency := Amount1 + Amount2;  -- 150.75
```

This ensures that currency calculations are exact.

**Fixed-Point Conversion**

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
type Float_Value is digits 15;
Amount : Currency := 100.50;
Float_Amount : Float_Value := Float_Value(Amount);
```

This converts between fixed-point and floating-point types.

#### Real-World Example: Medical Device System

In a medical device that monitors patient vital signs:

```ada
type Temperature is delta 0.1 range 30.0..45.0;
Current_Temperature : Temperature := 37.5;
```

This ensures that temperature readings are always accurate to one decimal place, preventing rounding errors that could affect diagnosis.

## 5.7 Practical Examples of Scalar Types

### 5.7.1 A Case Study: Chemical Reaction Analysis

Consider a chemical reactor control system where precise concentration and temperature measurements are critical.

#### Type Definitions

```ada
type Molarity is digits 8 range 0.0 .. 10.0;
type Temperature_K is range 0 .. 500;
type Pressure_Pa is digits 6 range 0.0 .. 1_000_000.0;
```

#### Type-Safe Functions

```ada
function Calculate_Reaction_Rate
   (Concentration : Molarity;
    Temperature : Temperature_K) return Float
is
   -- Reaction rate calculation
begin
   return ...;
end Calculate_Reaction_Rate;
```

#### Type-Safe Usage

```ada
-- Valid call
Rate := Calculate_Reaction_Rate (Conc, Temp);

-- Invalid calls (all fail at compile time):
Rate := Calculate_Reaction_Rate (Pressure, Temp);  -- Wrong type
Rate := Calculate_Reaction_Rate (Conc, Pressure);  -- Wrong type
Rate := Calculate_Reaction_Rate (15.0, 600);  -- Out of range
```

This prevents a critical error where a pressure value might be mistakenly passed to a function expecting a temperature—a scenario that could cause dangerous overheating in a real chemical plant.

#### Detailed Chemical Reaction System

In a chemical reactor control system:

```ada
type Reactor_Temperature is range 0 .. 500;
type Reactor_Pressure is digits 6 range 0.0 .. 1_000_000.0;
type Reactor_Concentration is digits 8 range 0.0 .. 10.0;

procedure Control_Reactor
   (Temperature : Reactor_Temperature;
    Pressure : Reactor_Pressure;
    Concentration : Reactor_Concentration)
is
   -- Control logic
begin
   -- Safety checks
   if Temperature > 450 then
      Trigger_Alarm("Overheat detected");
   end if;
   
   if Pressure > 900_000.0 then
      Trigger_Alarm("High pressure detected");
   end if;
   
   if Concentration > 8.0 then
      Trigger_Alarm("High concentration detected");
   end if;
   
   -- Control operations
   -- ...
end Control_Reactor;
```

This structure ensures that all reactor parameters stay within safe limits, preventing dangerous conditions.

### 5.7.2 A Case Study: A Fly-by-Wire Flight Control System

Modern aircraft rely on complex control systems where precision is paramount.

#### Type Definitions

```ada
type Altitude_Ft is new Float range 0.0 .. 50_000.0;
type Airspeed_Kts is new Float range 0.0 .. 1_000.0;
type Engine_Thrust is new Float range 0.0 .. 100.0;  -- Percentage
```

#### Control System Logic

```ada
procedure Adjust_Thrust (Control : in out Flight_Control; New_Thrust : Engine_Thrust) is
begin
   Control.Thrust := New_Thrust;
end Adjust_Thrust;
```

#### Error Prevention

```ada
-- Valid call
Adjust_Thrust (Control, 75.0);

-- Invalid calls (all fail at compile time):
Adjust_Thrust (Control, -10.0);  -- Out of range
Adjust_Thrust (Control, 150.0);  -- Out of range
Adjust_Thrust (Control, 1500.0);  -- Wrong type (airspeed instead of thrust)
```

This prevents a critical error where a pilot's altitude input might be mistakenly used for thrust control—a scenario that could cause catastrophic loss of control.

#### Detailed Flight Control System

In a flight control system:

```ada
type Altitude_Ft is new Float range 0.0 .. 50_000.0;
type Airspeed_Kts is new Float range 0.0 .. 1_000.0;
type Engine_Thrust is new Float range 0.0 .. 100.0;
type Pitch_Angle is new Float range -90.0 .. 90.0;

procedure Adjust_Altitude (Control : in out Flight_Control; New_Altitude : Altitude_Ft)
  with Pre => New_Altitude <= Control.Current_Altitude + 1000.0;

procedure Adjust_Airspeed (Control : in out Flight_Control; New_Airspeed : Airspeed_Kts)
  with Pre => New_Airspeed <= Control.Max_Airspeed;

procedure Adjust_Pitch (Control : in out Flight_Control; New_Pitch : Pitch_Angle)
  with Pre => New_Pitch >= -30.0 and New_Pitch <= 30.0;
```

This structure ensures that flight control inputs are always within safe limits, preventing dangerous maneuvers that could cause structural damage or loss of control.

### 5.7.3 A Case Study: Financial Transaction System

Financial systems require precise decimal arithmetic to avoid rounding errors.

#### Type Definitions

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
type Transaction_Count is range 1..1_000_000_000;
```

#### Transaction Processing

```ada
procedure Process_Transaction
   (Amount : Currency;
    Count : Transaction_Count)
is
begin
   -- Process transaction
end Process_Transaction;
```

#### Type Safety

```ada
-- Valid call
Process_Transaction (100.50, 1);

-- Invalid calls (all fail at compile time):
Process_Transaction (100.5, 1);  -- Wrong type (Float instead of Currency)
Process_Transaction (100.50, 1.0);  -- Wrong type (Float instead of Transaction_Count)
Process_Transaction (100.50, 0);  -- Out of range for count
```

This prevents a critical error where a transaction amount might be mistakenly used as a count, or where floating-point imprecision causes financial discrepancies. In banking systems, even small rounding errors can accumulate to millions of dollars over time.

#### Detailed Financial System

In a financial transaction system:

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
type Account_Number is String(1..10);
type Transaction_Type is (Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer);

procedure Process_Transaction
   (Account : Account_Number;
    Amount : Currency;
    Type : Transaction_Type)
is
   -- Process transaction
begin
   -- Safety checks
   if Amount < 0.0 then
      raise Invalid_Transaction_Amount;
   end if;
   
   if Type = Withdrawal and Amount > Current_Balance then
      raise Insufficient_Funds;
   end if;
   
   -- Transaction operations
   -- ...
end Process_Transaction;
```

This structure ensures that financial transactions are always processed safely, preventing errors that could cause financial loss.

## 5.8 Summary and Conclusion

### 5.8.1 Review of Key Concepts

- Ada's scalar types provide precise control over data representation
- Variables and constants must be explicitly declared with clear types
- Blocks provide precise control over variable visibility and lifetime
- Types, subtypes, and derived types enable precise constraints and distinct identities
- Integer types include both signed and modular varieties for different use cases
- Enumeration types define closed sets of valid values
- Boolean logic includes short-circuit operators for safe condition evaluation
- Floating-point and fixed-point types ensure precise numeric representation

### 5.8.2 Why Scalar Types Matter

Scalar types are the foundation of Ada's safety guarantees. By defining precise constraints on every value, Ada ensures that:

- Only meaningful data enters the system
- Invalid states are impossible
- Unit mix-ups are prevented at compile time
- Numeric precision is guaranteed

As one senior engineer at Airbus noted: "In Ada, the type system is not a limitation—it is a superpower. It transforms what would be a debugging nightmare in other languages into a compile-time certainty."

By mastering scalar types, you'll write code that is not only correct but provably safe—ensuring your software is reliable from the very first line.

### 5.8.3 What's Next

In the next chapter, we'll explore Ada's composite types—arrays, records, and tagged types. You'll learn how to build complex data structures while maintaining the same level of safety and precision that scalar types provide. This foundation will prepare you for modules on generics, contracts, and concurrency in later chapters.

#### Real-World Example: Aerospace Industry

Consider the Boeing 787 Dreamliner flight control system, which contains over 2 million lines of Ada code. Engineers report that new team members become productive within days—not weeks—because the code is self-documenting. As one lead developer stated: "In Ada, the code is the documentation. You don't need to guess what a function does—you read its contract and scope."

This is the power of Ada's strong typing system. By defining precise types for every value, the code becomes self-documenting and self-checking, preventing errors before they occur.

#### Real-World Example: Medical Device Industry

Consider a medical device that monitors patient vital signs. The device uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. This ensures that values are always within physiological ranges, preventing errors that could harm patients.

For example, the heart rate type might be defined as:

```ada
type Heart_Rate is range 20..250;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to a heart rate variable is within the physiological range, preventing errors that could harm patients.

#### Real-World Example: Financial Industry

Consider a financial transaction system. The system uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for currency amounts and transaction counts. This ensures that values are always within financial limits, preventing errors that could cause financial loss.

For example, the currency type might be defined as:

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
```

This ensures that currency amounts are always accurate to two decimal places, preventing rounding errors that could cause financial loss.

These exercises will help you reinforce your understanding of Ada's scalar types and prepare you for more advanced topics in the next chapter.

### 5.8.5 Historical Context: The Evolution of Ada's Scalar Types

Ada's scalar types have evolved significantly since its creation in the 1970s. Here's a brief history of Ada's scalar types evolution:

- **Ada 83**: Introduced strong typing with range constraints for integers and floating-point types
- **Ada 95**: Added modular integers and improved floating-point precision control
- **Ada 2005**: Enhanced enumeration types with representation clauses
- **Ada 2012**: Introduced contract-based programming for scalar types
- **Ada 2022**: Added refined fixed-point types and improved floating-point precision control

Each revision has strengthened Ada's scalar types while adding capabilities that address real-world needs. This balance of stability and innovation is why Ada remains the language of choice for systems where failure is not an option.

### 5.8.6 Industry Statistics

Ada is used in a wide range of industries, including:

- **Aerospace**: Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A380, NASA Mars Rovers
- **Defense**: U.S. Department of Defense systems, European Defense Agency systems
- **Transportation**: European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), autonomous vehicles
- **Medical**: Medical devices, surgical robots, patient monitoring systems
- **Finance**: Banking systems, financial transaction systems, stock trading systems

Industry statistics show that Ada-based systems have significantly fewer defects than equivalent systems in other languages:

- **NASA**: 10x fewer software defects than comparable C systems
- **Airbus**: 90% fewer critical defects in Ada code compared to C code
- **U.S. Department of Defense**: 75% reduction in software-related failures in Ada systems
- **Medical device manufacturers**: 85% reduction in critical safety issues with Ada

These statistics demonstrate the power of Ada's strong typing system and safety features.

### 5.8.7 Real-World Case Study: Mars Rovers

Consider the NASA Mars Rovers, which use Ada for their flight software. The Mars Rovers have been operating on Mars for over 15 years, with no software-related failures. This is a testament to Ada's reliability and safety features.

The Mars Rovers use Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for every value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For example, the temperature type might be defined as:

```ada
type Temperature is range -150..50;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to a temperature variable is within the expected range, preventing errors that could harm the rover.

### 5.8.8 Real-World Case Study: Airbus A380

Consider the Airbus A380, which uses Ada for its flight control system. The A380 has been in service for over 15 years, with no software-related failures. This is a testament to Ada's reliability and safety features.

The A380 uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for every value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For example, the altitude type might be defined as:

```ada
type Altitude is new Float range 0.0 .. 50_000.0;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to an altitude variable is within the expected range, preventing errors that could harm the aircraft.

### 5.8.9 Real-World Case Study: European Rail Traffic Management System

Consider the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), which uses Ada for its signaling system. The ERTMS has been in service for over 10 years, with no software-related failures. This is a testament to Ada's reliability and safety features.

The ERTMS uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for every value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For example, the speed type might be defined as:

```ada
type Speed is new Float range 0.0 .. 350.0;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to a speed variable is within the expected range, preventing errors that could harm the train.

### 5.8.10 Real-World Case Study: Medical Device Manufacturer

Consider a medical device manufacturer that uses Ada for its patient monitoring system. The system has been in service for over 5 years, with no safety-related incidents. This is a testament to Ada's reliability and safety features.

The system uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for every value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For example, the heart rate type might be defined as:

```ada
type Heart_Rate is range 20..250;
```

This ensures that any value assigned to a heart rate variable is within the expected range, preventing errors that could harm patients.

### 5.8.11 Real-World Case Study: Financial Institution

Consider a financial institution that uses Ada for its transaction system. The system has been in service for over 10 years, with no financial errors. This is a testament to Ada's reliability and safety features.

The system uses Ada's strong typing system to define precise types for every value, ensuring that values are always within expected ranges. For example, the currency type might be defined as:

```ada
type Currency is delta 0.01 digits 15;
```

This ensures that currency amounts are always accurate to two decimal places, preventing rounding errors that could cause financial loss.
